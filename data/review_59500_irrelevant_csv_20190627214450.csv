Local agroforestry practices for food and nutrition security of smallholder farm households in southwestern Ethiopia.,"","Abstract: Food and nutrition security (FNS) rests on five pillars: availability, access, utilization, stability, and sovereignty. We assessed the potentials of local agroforestry practices (AFPs) for enabling FNS for smallholders in the Yayu Biosphere Reserve (southwestern Ethiopia). Data was collected from 300 households in a stratified random sampling scheme through semi-structured interviews and farm inventory. Utility, edibility, and marketability value were the key parameters used to determine the potential of plants in the AFPs. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were employed to determine the form, variation, and association of local AFP attributes. Homegarden, multistorey-coffee-system, and multipurpose-trees-on-farmlands are the predominant AFPs in Yayu. Multipurpose-trees-on-farmlands are used mainly for food production, multistorey-coffee-system for income-generation, and homegarden for both. The 127 useful plant species identified represent 10 major plant utility groups, with seven (food, fodder, fuel, coffee-shade, timber, non-timber-forest-products, and medicinal uses) found in all three AFPs. In total, 80 edible species were identified across all AFPs, with 55 being primarily cultivated for household food supply. Generally, household income emanates from four major sources, multistorey-coffee-system (60%), homegarden (18%), multipurpose-trees-on-farmlands (13%), and off-farm activities (11%). Given this variation in form, purpose, and extracted benefits, existing AFPs in Yayu support the FNS of smallholders in multiple ways. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Programs found: adivasi fishery project (AFP) ### Topics keywords: ANOVA;nutrition security;rural household;significant difference;analysis variance;descriptive statistic;household income;agroforestry system;farm size;semi structured interview;agroforestry practice;family farming;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2018,,Sustainability,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/su10082722,,#36734,,"",""
Impacts of Land Use Change on Guatemalan Food Sovereignty,"","Abstract: In 2014 the World Food Programme estimated that 130,000 smallholder farmers in Guatemala lost crops due to a drought . That same year Guatemala also enjoyed 5-year highs in the production of water-intensive large-scale export crops: banana and sugar cane . This is one example of a series of food price and climate shocks that have caused many to question the impact of the global food system on the world’s poor. Guatemala is a particularly pointed example of the issues many countries face. Its fertile soil and varied climatic regions make it a productive place to grow food. This has led to it becoming an important producer of specific agricultural goods such as coffee, sugar, bananas, and oilseed palm, yet it struggles with one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the Western Hemisphere as well as pervasive food insecurity. Some have argued that this trend is due to the allocation of prime agricultural resources to export agriculture and the forcing of non-export agriculture onto marginal lands with high climate vulnerability. This research quantifies the geographic changes in Guatemalan export and non-export agriculture over the period of 2003-2010 and relates those changes to the vulnerability of the domestic food supply to climate change and international food price spikes. I find that non-export agriculture is moving onto more marginal land at higher elevations which both reduces expected yields and increases the likelihood of crop failure. ### Countries mentioned: Guatemala ### Plant products search: sugarcane;oilseeds;bananas ### Programs found: world food program (WFP);food program;international food program ### Topics keywords: land use change;agro food;food insecurity;climate change;cover crop;CC;LUC;land use;sugar beet;raw material;large scale;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;food sovereignty;family farming;sugar cane;food security ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2018,,,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/2124651331?accountid=9902,,#37294,,"",""
Indispensable resources.,"","Abstract: This article examines the usefulness of agricultural biodiversity in tackling malnutrition and food security. Biodiversity through breeding of improved varieties will be important in areas such as Africa, where resources such as water are limited. But promoting biodiversity further through a combination of these improved varieties with traditional crops will ensure that the latter compensates for the nutrients lacking in the former. Another important use of agricultural biodiversity is to deliver greater food security through resilience and stability. Judicious use of agricultural biodiversity offers opportunities to limit risks and to intensify production at the same time. In its ability to buffer yields from season to season and to deliver improved nutrition, and to do so when few other options are available, agricultural biodiversity is perhaps at its most useful in precisely the kinds of marginal and fragile environments that are occupied by the poorest farmers. One obstacle to date is that other inherently simpler approaches to the use of genetic resources, and to the treatment of malnutrition, have tended to receive the lion's share of investment. But it is also the case that agricultural improvement and malnutrition are among the most effective areas in which to invest for economic and general development. In conclusion, a sustained and well-resourced effort to make use of agricultural biodiversity could help reduce poverty and malnutrition in Africa and elsewhere. ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;genetic resource;point view;FAO;food security",2008,,"D + C, Development and Cooperation",,,,,,,#37341,,"",""
Influence of a flavonoid (formononetin) on mycorrhizal activity and potato crop productivity in the highlands of Peru.,"","Abstract: Mycorrhizal fungi serve as biofertilizers, reduce plant stress, and can increase plant productivity. Since the potato originated from the highlands of Peru and Bolivia, a goal of this research was to utilize indigenous Peruvian mycorrhizal populations to enhance crop productivity in a subsistence production site. The field study was also conducted to test the effectiveness of the flavonoid, formononetin, to stimulate native mycorrhizal activity and subsequent yield of six Andean potato ( L.) cultivars. The subsistence site was located at an altitude of 3900 m (61 kPa) in San Jose de Aymara (Department of Huancavelica), in the central highlands of Peru. This is approaching the highest altitude in the world that potatoes are grown. The site had a sandy-loam soil with pH 3.6, low phosphorus (P) availability and high aluminum (Al). Tubers were planted in November 1999, and grown during the rainy season. Minimal organic fertilizer was applied and the potato crop received no supplementary irrigation. Formononetin was applied as a soil drench when shoots from tubers began to emerge. At the end of the 6.5 month study, formononetin increased either potato tuber dry mass and/or Nos. 1 and 2 grade tubers in three of the six cultivars. Soil sporulation of indigenous mycorrhizae was increased more than three-fold by formononetin. There were differences in total mycorrhizal colonization among the six cultivars. The predominant arbuscular mycorrhiza genera at the site were , and . ### Countries mentioned: Bolivia;Peru;United States;Costa Rica;Uruguay ### Plant products search: tuber;potatoes ### Measurements for interventions: phosphorus ### Topics keywords: DM;AMF;mycorrhizal fungi;organic fertilizer ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2005,,Scientia Horticulturae,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2005.04.013,,#36673,,"",""
Inorganic nitrogen dynamics in fallows and maize on an Oxisol and Alfisol in the highlands of Kenya,"","Abstract: Fallows with naturally regenerated or planted vegetation are important in many subsistence agricultural systems of tropical regions, but the underlying soil processes in fallows are not properly understood. We investigated N dynamics under different fallow vegetation on a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox (2372-mm rain in 16 months) and a Kandic Paleustalf (1266-mm rain in 15 months) in the Kenyan highlands. The treatments, which extended for three cropping seasons (15-16 months), were Zea mays (maize), natural regrowth of vegetation (natural fallow), planted Sesbania sesban (sesbania fallow) and uncultivated soil without vegetation (bare fallow), Inorganic N (nitrate + ammonium-N) to 2-m depth under bare fallow increased by 242 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on the Oxisol and 54 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on the Alfisol, indicating that N mineralization exceeded N losses. Subsoil inorganic N (0.5-2.0 m) remained relatively unchanged after three crops of unfertilized maize, which produced limited total biomass because of P deficiency. Inorganic N decreased during natural and sesbania fallows, and both fallows similarly depleted subsoil inorganic N. The fallows depleted inorganic N at 0.5-2.0 m by 75-125 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) down to a minimum N content between 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1). After slashing sesbania and incorporating the above-ground biomass with 154-164 kg N ha(-1), soil inorganic N increased within 2 months by 136 kg N ha(-1) on the Oxisol and 148 kg N ha(-1) on the Alfisol. Inorganic N decreased after cropping the bare fallow on the Oxisol with maize, indicating that inorganic N was prone to leaching during heavy rains when the maize was small. A considerable part of the N in biomass of the natural fallow was recycled. Much of the total N accumulated by the sesbania fallow was removed with the wood and the amount of N recycled was similar an the Oxisol and Alfisol. We conclude that sesbania fallows can retrieve considerable subsoil inorganic N on deep soils with high subsoil N and effectively cycle this N through its rapidly decomposable biomass to subsequent crops. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: sesbania;maize ### Measurements for interventions: ground biomass ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;paddy field;TN;NH4;TP;NO3;NH4 N ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2000,,GEODERMA,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7061(00)00072-0,,#37519,,"",""
Integrated pest management in the small farmer's maize crop in Nicaragua.,"","Abstract: Details are given of work carried out in Nicaragua to develop a programme of integrated pest management for maize. The crop is grown there by small farmers and the major insect pests are Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) and Diatraea lineolata (Wlk.). Damage in the first 2-3 weeks after emergence was attributable to feeding by the larvae on the meristem tissues of the bud and the loss could be compensated for by sowing at higher densities than normal and thinning the infested plants 2-3 weeks after emergence. The need for early chemical treatments was thus avoided and the natural enemies were safeguarded. The main parasites of S. frugiperda were Rogas laphygmae Vier. and Chelonus insularis Cress.; the larvae were preyed on by Doru taeniatum (Dohrn) and adversely affected by heavy rainfall. During the later stages of maize growth, S. frugiperda was heavily attacked by Lespesia archippivora (Ril.), Hexamermis sp. and several insect predators. The main natural enemy of Diatraea lineolata was the egg parasite Trichogramma pretiosum Ril. Despite the natural enemies, control measures were needed once 20% of the whorls were damaged by S. frugiperda. Treatments should be with granules or insecticidal baits placed directly in the whorls, preferably only in the infested ones. Cage studies indicated that the yield losses caused by D. lineolata were 3-6%/borer per plant, but chemical control was not considered to be justified and other measures such as stalk and stubble burning in the dry season are emphasised. Under drought conditions, control of S. frugiperda did not increase yields; the use of fertilizers stimulated both pests. Fertilizers only increased yields when combined with chemical protection of the whorl. Intercropping of maize and beans reduced the damage to maize by both pests. Grassy weeds (mainly Digitaria sp. and Eleusine indica) tended to harbour larvae of Spodoptera, and infestation of maize was higher in plots with weeds than in weeded plots. It is recommended that a maize resistance breeding programme should be established in Central America to concentrate on S. frugiperda and that the introduction into Nicaragua of exotic parasites of S. frugiperda should be considered. ### Countries mentioned: Nicaragua ### Plant products search: maize;grain legumes ### Animal products search: eggs ### Programs found: breeding program (BP);developed program;program integrated pest management (IPM) ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;integrated pest management;spatial distribution;non IPM;natural enemy;biological control;IPM;insect pest;sweet potato;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;pest control;human activity ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1981,,Mededelingen Landbouwhogeschool Wageningen,,,,,,,#37482,,"",""
Integrated watershed management-experience in the Shivaliks of Hoshiarpur.,"","Abstract: The Shivaliks of Hoshiarpur (Punjab) extend to the adjoining areas of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. Farming in these areas is of subsistence type and productivity is low. Suitable dryland technology for these areas is now available and the impact of different components of technology, viz in situ conservation of soil and water, selection of suitable crops and varieties, optimum fertilizer use and runoff collection, and recycling, have been identified as steps necessary for increasing production and reducing erosion. The farmers are convinced of the value of technology but its dissemination is low due to lack of an integrated approach. Due to the undulating topography, suitable land shaping is considered essential and the entire 3-5 km wide belt of the Shivalik foothill soils needs suitable land treatment. This area needs to be treated on a watershed basis with at least 75% subsidy for land treatment. The element of risk continues to exist in the minds of the farmers due to weather aberrations and it can only be reduced through efficient collection and utilization of available runoff water for supplemental irrigation for stabilizing crop production. Suitable sites for runoff collection need to be identified and works executed in a phased manner as a national programme. The resource-poor farmers are not in a position to take up major land improvement programme without state help. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Programs found: national program;land improvement program ### Topics keywords: protected area;genetic diversity;point view ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1988,,National seminar on water management: the key to developing agriculture.,,,,,,,#36206,,"",""
INTENSIFICATION OF PEASANT AGRICULTURE IN YUCATAN,"","Abstract: This is a study of the spontaneous intensification of peasant agriculture in Yucatan, a semi-arid limestone plain in the lowland tropics of southeastern Mexico. Maize, the staple food crop, has always been grown almost exclusively in small communities of Maya peasants. The milpa, a traditional, slash-and-burn system of continuous rotation through forest fallow, has persisted because it is adapted to the thin, rocky soils and irregular rainfall patterns. The majority of the Maya were absorbed as debt-peons into plantations which produced sisal fiber for export in the 19th Century. After the Revolution of 1912-1917, a program of agrarian reform permitted a brief-resurgence and re-expansion of their traditional economy. In recent decades they have faced an increasingly serious dilemma. Due to shortened fallow periods, deteriorating price relationships, and rising economic expectations, milpa agriculture can neither assure the security of the household food supply nor provide them with an adequate income. Most families simultaneously produce a portion of their subsistence needs, sell agricultural products, and work off the farm on a seasonal or intermittent basis. This case study concentrates on the Puuc zone, one of the few areas of Yucatan where Maya peasants have been able to develop more intensive production systems. Over the past 40 years, approximately 3,500 families have gradually shifted from subsistence-oriented milpa to the cultivation of fruits and vegetables for the regional market. Small-scale irrigation units were constructed by the Federal government, but the farmers retained the autonomy to modify their traditional technology and grow annual, semi-perennial and perennial crops in various combinations and sequences. They have developed their parcels with small, incremental investments of labor time and cash earned in migratory labor. Their operations are organized to minimize risk in an uncertain economic environment, and to build up equity in the long-term security of their households. Although yields and net returns are modest compared to large commercial orchards, they have stabilized the economy of many families. Recent government programs designed to introduce modern fruit and vegetable production into Yucatan have been less successful. . . . (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

"Interannual variation in area and productivity of crops as influenced by rainfall, soil and land holding in changeri micro-watershed of Udaipur District of Rajasthan","","Abstract: Reasons for yield gap on the farms owned by medium to large farmers and marginal to small farmers have been investigated based on the socio-economic survey of 130 farm families and soil characteristics. Reasons for inter-annual variation in land use pattern from 2002 to 2004 were also studied simultaneously. Better soil conditions such as depth, texture, water holding capacity, slope and good management were the causes for 30 to 50% higher yield on the farms owned by medium to large farmers as compared to the farms belonging to marginal to small farmers. Food habits and dietary needs control the area for maize, whereas per capita return and lower water requirement influenced the area under groundnut, mustard and cumin. Sub-optimal rainfall sometimes led to increased area under sorghum at the cost of other kharif crops. Water available for irrigation, which is declining on account of depleting ground water resources, decided the area of wheat crop. ### Plant products search: wheat;cumin;sorghum grain;maize;groundnuts;mustard ### Topics keywords: land use;yield gap;bulk density;management practice",2008,,Annals of Arid Zone,,,,,,,#37456,,"",""

"Land cover changes, autumn rainfall and soil vulnarabilities in the Bouregreg watershed in Morocco [Changement des états de surface, précipitations automnales et vulnérabilité des sols dans le bassin versant du Bouregreg au Maroc]","","Abstract: The Bouregreg watershed is located in the Rabat-Salé- Zemour Region in Morocco. It is a pastoral area in the interior mountainous parts and agro-pastoral in the plains. Like most watersheds of Atlantic Morocco, the landscape dynamics observed in the Bouregreg watershed are marked by an intensification of agricultural areas in the plains and their extension to the slopes. Indeed, land cover supervised classification using Landsat images around 1987 and 2006 indicate land cover changes in the Bouregreg watershed. Between 1987 and 2006, over the entire watershed, 15% of the wooded areas have been converted into agricultural areas. When taking the morphology of the watershed into account, the study shows the fragility of these agricultural areas. Indeed, 30% of the cultivated areas are located on slopes from 5 to 10%, and 24% on slopes from 10 to 20%. These croplands exhibit almost no vegetation during land preparation and planting. The archiving and seasonal monitoring of variations in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from the SPOT vegetation sensor for the period from 2001 to 2009, reveal at the beginning and end of growing seasons, a lengthening of the period during which the soil is almost bare during the years of exceptional drought. In addition, analysis of the rainfall time series at the Rabat meteorological station shows a modification of autumn rainfall regime since 1999, with an increasing trend specifically during October. This situation is likely to make the bare soil on steep slopes vulnerable to erosion by rain especially during particularly dry years like 2003 and 2007. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco ### Measurements for interventions: cultivated area ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;short term;VI;time series;land cover;land use;growing season;land cover change;NDVI;vegetation index;LUCC;normalized difference vegetation index;long term ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,Revue des Sciences de l'Eau,,,,,https://doi.org/10.7202/1016060ar,,#37126,,"",""
"Land Degradation in Central Asia: Evidence, Perception and Policy","","Abstract: The introduction of communism into Central Asia brought agricultural transformation on a massive scale. Irrigation projects, expansion of livestock numbers and ploughing of the northern steppe modified vegetation and soils. Despite initial censorship, in the late Soviet period resources available for the study of land degradation processes were substantial and large scale mapping projects defined uniform criteria for degradation type and severity. Scientists found that degradation of vegetation cover from grazing was widespread, although productivity losses were slight in many areas. Tighter regulation led to stabilization of forest cover. Perhaps the most acute form of degradation was soil salinization, and the related Aral Sea disaster. Independence brought economic crisis: privatization turned salaried workers into subsistence farmers, dependant on local resources for survival. The early years were characterized by ploughing of marginal land in the mountains; abandonment of steppe fields for want of machinery; collapse in livestock inventories; and increasing reliance on wood for fuel. These changes led to a new mixture of degradation and recovery processes. Yet these were poorly documented, as funding for science collapsed and trained personnel migrated or retired. Institutes came to depend on environment-focussed development projects, so incentives to keep degradation on the agenda became strong. Such projects fund little basic science-so most statistics used to justify them were based on data from the 1980s or on more recent national data unaccompanied by documentation of methodology. Some research funding became available through international scientific collaborations, which have improved our understanding of specific processes such as grazing, soil erosion and deforestation. But much of this research is case-study based and cannot be scaled up. Studies at the national or regional scale often involve time-series analysis of remotely sensed vegetation indices. These have revealed responses to climatic factors, but so far have provided only speculative documentation of anthropogenic degradation processes over large areas. ### Programs found: large scale (LIS) mapping project;scale irrigation project;irrigation project;development project;large scale irrigation (LSI) project;mapping project ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;short term;soil erosion;VI;land use change;time series;land cover;land degradation;vegetation cover;forest cover;LD;NDVI;protected area;vegetation index;large scale;long term ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia",2016,,END OF DESERTIFICATION?: DISPUTING ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN THE DRYLANDS,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16014-1_17,,#36703,,"",""
Land use conflicts in pastoral development in northern Côte d'Ivoire.,"","Abstract: The agricultural geography of West Africa has witnessed the southerly migration of Fulani herds from the Sudano-Sahelian region to the subhumid savannas of Sierra Leone, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. This migratory drift of herds and herders represents a new development for the Fulani, because it is occurring well within the Tsetse belt, an area normally avoided by Fulani herders in the past, because of the hazards of animal sleeping sickness. This migration pattern is explained by a number of factors such as land use competition between peasants and herders in the Sudano-Sahelian region, land degradation linked to changing social relations of production and demographic pressures, drought and restricted access to formerly open rangelands. In the case of Côte d'Ivoire, Fulani herd owners from Burkina Faso and Mali have been attracted to the country for its better pastures, low population densities, proximity to markets and the veterinary care and subsidies provided by their livestock development corporation. This chapter examines the inadequacy of pursuing technocratic approaches to solving interlocking political, economic, and cultural-ecological problems affecting land use in the context of the Senufo-Fulani Tandem Project. The case study shows that the interactive effects of land use conflicts at three overlapping levels continue to undermine both the expansion of Fulani livestock production and the intensification of agricultural systems in the savanna region. An overview of the evolution of the above project is given. Multiple land use conflicts at the regional and national levels integral to this pastoral development debacle are focused on. ### Countries mentioned: Sierra Leone;Mali;Burkina Faso;Central African Republic;Cote d'Ivoire;Cameroon;Sudan ### Programs found: evolution project;senufo fulani tandem project ### Topics keywords: spatial distribution;land degradation;biological control;land use;population density;LD;protected area;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",1993,,Land in African agrarian systems..,,,,,,,#36769,,"",""
Land-use options in Sikkim Himalaya: an analysis from the Mamlay watershed of south district.,"","Abstract: Using data from a primary survey conducted in 1991 of 64 farm households, five land-use options, pertaining to crop rotations, are evaluated from the Mamlay watershed of south district in Sikkim Himalaya. Productivity and profitability of the five crop rotations are specified using budgeting techniques. Land-use options are assessed in terms of crop preference, productivity, profitability, resource requirements (land, labour and power), soil quality and risks. The results indicate that maize/ginger/pulse and maize/potato are very profitable, but higher risk and capital inputs make these land-use options difficult for marginal and small holding farmers. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: maize;ginger;grain legumes;potatoes ### Topics keywords: crop rotation;land use;survey conducted;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1995,,Journal of Sustainable Agriculture,,,,,,,#36953,,"",""

Linkages between land management activities and stream water quality in a border dyke-irrigated pastoral catchment.,"","Abstract: This paper describes key linkages between land management activities and stream water quality for a 5230 ha catchment used for intensive pastoral agriculture in southern New Zealand. Due to low annual rainfall and the wide coverage of soils with low available water-holding capacities, flood irrigation of the 2400 ha of flat land within the catchment is an important feature impacting on farm business profitability and stream health. Water quality variables and nutrient and sediment yield estimates are reported for a four-year period. This monitoring shows that some improvement in farm environmental performances would generally be desirable, with stream concentrations of nutrients (N and P), sediment and faecal bacteria regularly exceeding guidelines recommended for surface waters. Field measurements, farm management surveys and farm systems modelling have identified some land management practices that appear to be key sources of many of these pollutants. Border dyke irrigation runoff has a potentially large effect on a range of water quality parameters, due to both the excessive stream flows generated by over-watering and the entrainment of P, N and faecal bacteria in this flow as it passes from land to stream. Stock access to some of the remaining un-fenced lengths of the stream was also recognised as an important land management practice that needed to be addressed if some of the key catchment values identified by stakeholders, such as maintaining a healthy trout fishery and a stream suitable for recreational use, were to be protected. Assessments of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a number of potential mitigation practices identified that managements which targeted reducing irrigation runoff (e.g. by installing bunds or using appropriate watering times) and fencing and planting riparian margins showed the greatest potential to meet these key values with least cost to farm businesses. Other farm practices were also identified that incurred nil or minimal cost while also delivering small or moderate benefits to stream water quality. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Topics keywords: NH4;bulk density;NO3;management practice ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2008.08.017,,#37163,,"",""
Linking smallholder agriculture and water to household food security and nutrition,"","Abstract: Promoting household food security and reducing malnutrition rates of a growing population with the same amount of water is a challenge facing South African nutritionists and agriculturalists alike. Apart from non-food related effects of agriculture in general, the crop and livestock production practices of the South African smallholder farmer may have nutritional implications, primarily when practised on residential land and resulting in home consumption. Yet, few studies have systematically investigated the impact thereof. It appears that crop diversification, gender issues and nutrition education are among the important factors that strengthen the link between agriculture and nutrition. Since food production is the most water-intensive activity in society, nutritional water productivity (i.e. nutrition per volume water) of foods and the nutritional water footprint of diets should be investigated in order to achieve a sustainable solution. This implies that both the demand for a diet consisting predominantly of water-productive plant products, as well as the supply thereof, be addressed. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;drought stress;water saving;SA;household food security;LCA;smallholder farmer;water footprint;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2007,,Water SA,,,,,,,#36310,,"",""
Livelihood diversification: Continuity and change in the Sahel,"","Abstract: Livelihood diversification can be crucial for poor rural households in the African Sahel. Migration is a common diversification strategy during the dry season, but there are also areas with significant strategies on the farm, such as incomes from gum and resins. Sudan is a country where the income from gum arabic, the gum from the Acacia senegal tree, has played a large economic role for smallholders for generations, but there are signs of a declining production which is detrimental if people have no alternative incomes. The results showed that in parts of the country, the 1984 drought caused an event-driven change resulting in a discontinuation of production. However, in other parts of the country, the agricultural system providing gum arabic proved to be more resilient to the drought and the incomes from gum arabic still play a large role. The results illustrated a complexity of driving forces, regional differences and a large variability in incomes between households. Some causes were indirect such as prices, drought, precipitation and locust, whereas the others were direct and hence more controllable by households. This study underlined the direct causes, such as how labour input is prioritised between livelihood activities, which have not been given as much attention in previous literature. Secondly, the need for a holistic view of livelihoods is underlined in order to understand the future of gum arabic production. Empirical data were collected from extensive fieldwork. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan;Senegal ### Topics keywords: small scale;land use change;food insecurity;spatial distribution;driving force;rural household;cultivated land;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2006,,GeoJournal,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-007-9043-6,,#36962,,"",""
"Local communities' accountability for natural resource conservation: a comparative study of Chiro and Fiche, Ethiopia.","","Abstract: Ethiopia's natural resources base, its land, water, forests and trees are the foundation of any economic development, food security and other basic necessities of its people. Smallholder agriculture is the dominant sector that provides over 85 percent of the total employment and foreign exchange earnings and approximately above 45 percent of the GDP. However, natural resource degradation is a major concern for Ethiopia's poor rural communities. Post-modernism approach to natural resource management assumes that sustainability of specific natural resource conservation and management measures is at risk when local communities feel no ownership over the resources for the way it is used and managed. The main purpose of this study was, therefore, to assess conduciveness of factors for local communities' accountability for natural resource conservation in Chiro and Fiche area, Ethiopia. The research variables were economic benefits; right and access to natural resources; and knowledge and capacity to implement conservation activities. For comparison purpose, two successful and unsuccessful watershed developments were purposively chosen for this study. Data were collected using survey instrument from 304 head of households sample population in Fiche and Chiro areas within Ethiopia. Qualitative data were also collected through interview and document review. The study used descriptive statistics represented by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test was also used to analyze whether or not significant variation existed between the sites. The results indicated high local communities' accountability for natural resource conservation in Chiro. Existence of economic benefits is a critical and an effective means to provide the incentive for feeling a sense of ownership by the local communities. Knowledge and capacity of carrying out conservation activity is equally vital for successful implementation of community based natural resource conservation. It is also possible to implement successful community based natural resource conservation under the existing rural land ownership system in Ethiopia. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: natural resource;land degradation;GDP;rural community;used analyze;factor affecting;descriptive statistic;large scale;natural resource management;land reform;rural tourism;protected area;economic benefit;farm size;social capital;food security;local community;land ownership;factor influencing;gross domestic product ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2014,,Developing Country Studies,,,,,,,#36951,,"",""
An integrated approach to assess the dynamics of a pen-urban watershed influenced by wastewater irrigation,"","Abstract: In many urban and pen-urban areas of India, wastewater is under-recognized as a major water resource. Wastewater irrigated agriculture provides direct benefits for the livelihoods and food security of many smallholder farmers. A rapidly urbanizing pen-urban micro-watershed (270 ha) in Hyderabad was assessed over a 10-year period from 2000 to 2010 for changes in land use and associated farming practices, farmer perceptions, socio-economic evaluation, land-use suitability for agriculture and challenges in potential irrigated area development towards wastewater use. This integrated approach showed that the change in the total irrigated area was marginal over the decade, whereas the built-up area within the watershed boundaries doubled and there was a distinct shift in cropping patterns from paddy rice to paragrass and leafy vegetables. Local irrigation supplies were sourced mainly from canal supplies, which accounted for three-quarters of the water used and was largely derived from wastewater. The remainder was groundwater from shallow hard-rock aquifers. Farmer perception was that the high nutrient content of the wastewater was of value, although they were also interested to pay modest amounts for additional pre-treatment. The shift in land use towards paragrass and leafy vegetables was attributed to increased profitability due to the high urban demand. The unutilised scrubland within the watershed has the potential for irrigation development, but the major constraints appear to be unavailability of labour and high land values rather than water availability. The study provides evidence to support the view that the opportunistic use of wastewater and irrigation practices, in general, will continue even under highly evolving pen-urban conditions, to meet the livelihood needs of the poor driven by market demands, as urban sprawl expands into cultivable rural hinterlands. Policy support is needed for enhanced recognition of wastewater for agriculture, with flow-on benefits including improved public health and protection of ecosystem services. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan;India ### Plant products search: rice;leafy vegetables ### Topics keywords: organic farming;irrigated agriculture;cropping system;land degradation;water saving;rural community;RO;public health;CI;farming practice;farming system;long term;paddy field;cropping pattern;anaerobic digestion;human health;food safety;risk assessment;farmer perception;economic benefit;animal health;management practice;food security;ecosystem service;land use;paddy rice;extension service;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture;pre treatment ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.001,,#36874,,"",""
"Development agencies and their clients: The case of the En Nahud Smallholder Agricultural Project (ENSAP), Sudan","","Abstract: This thesis is concerned with rural development in Ghubeish village communities in En Nahud district, Northern Kordofan, Sudan. The area currently experiences an intervention in its traditional rain-fed agriculture by an NGO and is supposedly an area where rural development is underway. The thesis has to make use of an 'eclectic approach' which, in my view, is theoretically grounded to provide a holistic account of the development process. The 'eclectic approach' is an amlagam of the micro- and macro-approaches to development. Traditional anthropological approaches to development are mostly predicated on the too narrow premises of micro-models (e.g. transactional, actor-oriented etc.), and this renders them ill-equipped to take any account of the macro-level processes (such as local government, agencies etc.), which come directly to bear on the local scene. This, plainly, does not fully grasp the totality of the development enterprise (micro and macro). Despite being viewed as polar opposites, both the micro- and macro-approaches are necessary for the study of rural development at the local level. Rather than detracting from theoretical strength, combining such models in an overall 'eclectic approach' adds to the vigour of the theoretical analysis. Ten villages were selected for the present study, with between 274 and 1957 inhabitants. The population is from the Hamar tribe, which has historically witnessed a long process of transformation from semi-pastoralism to sedentary agriculture, combining subsistence and cash crop production. The basis of agriculture is predominantly traditional, using simple implements in a savannah environment. The majority of the inhabitants are smallholder farmers cultivating less than thirty makhamas (1 makhamas = 1.79 acres), though a significant proportion are large landowners. In addition to household labour hired labour and sharaka (share- cropping) contribute to the overall structure of the farming system. Despite the fact that land remains plentiful, expansion of the area under cultivation was restricted by capital shortage (which gave rise to informal and exploitative credit systems), and the simplicity of the agricultural technique. The intention this thesis is to bring to the foreground the views and perceptions of the people in these villages who are affected by the development project and to compare them with those held by the agency itself. It is shown that some of the respective views square and others diverge, whilst closer communication works to bridge the misunderstanding and misplaced stereotyping held by both sides. The study also shows that the government authority tends to ignore the villagers in their remoteness despite its plans for community development. Evaluation of the project shows that over the limited period of three years (mid-term) of project implementation the agency has partly succeeded in its experiment with institutionalising a low-cost and sustainable credit/extension system appropriate to the needs of smallholder farmers. But, on balance, it had had a limited impact towards reaching its goal of raising, significantly, smallholders' income. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan ### Programs found: community development (CD) project;nahud smallholder agricultural project;rural development (RD) project;term project;development project;agricultural project;agriculture project;agrikultura project;rural development project (RDP) ### Topics keywords: cover crop;take account;rural community;rural household;point view;taking account;taken account;cash crop;rural development;NGO;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;farming system;contract farming ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1994,,,,,,,http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1826807459?accountid=9783,,#37495,,"",""
"'Land grabs' in Africa: pathways, trends and the role of legal contracts.","","Abstract: This article discusses how land grabbing in Africa compromises local land rights and other issues and discusses the role of government and international agencies in developing and enforcing equitable land contracts. Quantitative inventories of documented, approved land allocations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Madagascar and Mali from 2004 to 2008 total some 2 million hectares. Further growth is anticipated. As outside interest for land acquisitions rise, and as governments or markets make land available to prospecting investors, local people could loose access to the resources on which they depend - not just land, but also water, wood and grazing. While there is a perception that farmland is abundant in certain countries, these claims are not always substantiated. In many cases, land is already being used or claimed - yet people using the land have no formal land rights. If international land deals are to boost opportunities and mitigate risks, each project will have to be properly scrutinized and have the right terms and conditions. Land deals are embodied in one or several contracts. But the analysis of a small number of contracts from Africa highlights two challenges that can threaten the balance of the deal: safeguarding local interests and maximizing local benefits. Security of local land rights is key to protect people from arbitrary dispossession and to give them an asset to negotiate with. The contracts tend to lack robust mechanisms to monitor or enforce compliance with investor commitments, promote smallholder participation in production activities, and balance food security concerns in home and host countries. Host governments should use policy incentives to promote inclusive business models that share value with local enterprises, including small-scale farmers, processors and service providers. Governments should also seek more specific and enforceable investor commitments on investment levels, job creation, infrastructure development and public revenues; and effective mechanisms to hold investors to account. Development agencies can play a useful role by creating space for public debate; strengthening host government capacity to negotiate and civil society capacity to scrutinize; accompanying efforts to secure local land rights; sharing lessons from international experience; and ensuring that international rules establish robust safeguards and are backed by effective monitoring and enforcement. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana;Madagascar;Ethiopia;Mali ### Programs found: risk project ### Topics keywords: small scale;land right;land grab;natural resource;arable land;land reform;land grabbing;local people;million hectare;protected area;extension service;large scale;small scale farmer;medicinal plant;land acquisition;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2010,,Rural 21,,,,,,,#36580,,"",""
Drought and change amongst northern Kenya nomadic pastoralists: the case of the Rendille and Gabra.,"","Abstract: The Rendille and Gabra are peoples who inhabit rangelands in Marsabit District, Northern Kenya, and who are primarily nomadic pastoralists. This chapter assesses the responses of both peoples to drought, as their populations have increased and they have become more integrated into the wider political economy. The changes in their behaviour and attitudes are traced over 3 time periods: 1918-39, 1940-63, and 1963-80, which reflect varying degrees of contact with the wider polity and economy. The frequency and management of droughts is first addressed from the perspectives of the Gabra, the Rendille and the administration, followed by a detailed analysis. Evidence suggests that neither over-grazing nor unfavourable shifts in relative prices between livestock and cereals are responsible for pushing people out of the pastoral system. The major issue is that increases in livestock numbers are currently insufficient to support increases in the human population. Thus, non-pastoral sources of income are gaining importance while livestock production remains the mainstay of the population. In conclusion, some recommendations are made for improving the pastoral system. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: contract farming;special issue;land reform;political economy ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1990,,From water to world-making: African models and arid lands.,,,,,,,#37324,,"",""
Investigate and identify factors affecting the success of biological watershed operation of Gilan.,"","Abstract: One of the main sources of economic development in any countries is the rate of soil and water resources that conservation and efficient use of them could be an effective step towards achieving sustainable development, watershed activities perform as a conscious, purposeful and deliberate movement on the humanitarian community to avoid waste water and soil erosion.

Kenya's agriculture and the I.L.O. employment mission - six years after.,"","Abstract: In 1972 a UNDP/ILO mission assessed Kenya's employment problems (see WAERSA 15, 1907). For the agricultural sector three major thrusts were proposed for an employment and incomes strategy: (1) intensification of land use for both crops and livestock through improved farm techniques and practices; (2) redistribution of land to smaller, more labour-intensive farm units; (3) settlement of unused or underfertilized land. Policies proposed to support the intensification strategy included increased research and improved extension services, easier access to farm inputs, continuous review of marketing and price policies, expansion of hybrid maize and labour-intensive cash crops, introduction of intensive livestock production, rapid development of the beef industry in semi-arid areas and, in the longer term, a progressive land tax and ceiling on the size of individual land holdings. Attitudes of the mission and their opponents are assessed, as is the government's attitude and achievements. Generally, much effort has been made to implement the mission's recommendations. Economic success is largely due to the energy of those who operate within the free enterprise system, notably as regards the small-farm sector. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: maize ### Animal products search: beef ### Programs found: united nation development program (UNDP) ### Topics keywords: short term;cover crop;longer term;beef industry;land use;rural household;cash crop;extension service;sweet potato;farming system;beef cattle ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1978,,Journal of Modern African Studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022278X00021741,,#37656,,Abdrahmane Wane (2019-06-14 18:26:27)(Screen): too old to be included; ,""
Is Irrigation Water Free? A Reality Check in the Indo-Gangetic Basin,"","Abstract: ""Getting prices right"" is the silver bullet widely advocated to developing countries in fighting waste, misallocation and scarcity of water. In the vast, poverty-stricken Indo-Gangetic basin, however, high surrogate water price is driving out small-holder irrigation. With rising diesel prices, most small-holders who use borewells for irrigation find effective water use cost soaring, obliging them to economize on water use even by quitting irrigated farming. Electrified borewell owners, far fewer, face low marginal cost but have to contend with stringent electricity rationing. Public irrigation systems grossly under-price irrigation, but these are getting marginalized despite massive government and donor investments. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;land reform;developing country",2009,,World Development,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1102057&site=ehost-live,,#36679,,"",""
Irrigation recommendations - an important aid in decision making for outdoor vegetable production.,"","Abstract: An electronic data processing irrigation advisory service in Frankfurt is described. Plantations over 50 ha receive specific recommendations twice a week while smaller holdings rely on the daily press. The initial project on 18 vegetable crops was enlarged to 29 using various technologies. Vegetable productivity was considerably increased under irrigation. Data for cabbage, cucumber, kohlrabi, celery, cauliflower and lettuce yields in 1983 and 1984 are presented. It is concluded that regularity of yields from field grown vegetables cannot be secured without additional irrigation. Vegetables differed in their irrigation requirements but they all needed a regular water supply. ### Plant products search: kohlrabi;leafy vegetables;inflorescence vegetables;cucumbers ### Topics keywords: animal health;decision making;extension service;advisory service",1985,,Gartenbau,,,,,,,#36455,,"",""
Macro price shocks and nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa,"","Abstract: Macro price shocks are a concern to the general public and policy makers because these price movements intensify inflationary pressures, increase the uncertainty confronting farmers and agribusiness firms with significant impacts on food security. The current spike in global food prices exceeds all previous records. Food prices increased 2-38 percent per year in Africa during the past three decades, whilst the price of crude oil has more than quadrupled since 2002. The food price increases are driven by several factors, including drought, low food stocks in global market, speculation, declining trends in agricultural production in low-income countries, increasing biofuel production, food demand and income growth in emerging markets. Food accounts for up to 73 percent of household expenditures in Africa. The combination of climate change, rising food and input prices, poor performance of domestic agriculture sector, and high population growth rates is creating significant food shortages in some African countries. Food is imported to bridge the gap between domestic demand and production, thereby, protecting consumption levels. Sub-Saharan Africa currently imports approximately 71.0 percent of its total food supply. Chronic hunger depletes people's ability for increased productivity and increases their susceptibility to diseases. Indeed, whilst high food prices may be good for farmers and food exporters, they could exercabate food insecurity for the poor who may not have access to food at affordable prices. We use five decades of annual data and a vector error correction model to examine the relationship between macro price shocks and nutrition in Africa. The model identifies and evaluates the strength of the linkages between variables which enables us to trace the dynamic responses in the system at different time horizons in reaction to specific shocks. The empirical results suggest that shocks to food prices, exchange rates and trade policies have significant impacts on nutrition, real incomes and per capita domestic food production. There are strong feedbacks amongst the variables and rapid adjustment towards long-run equilibrium levels after a shock in the system. This information is useful for the formulation of appropriate policies to solve the growing food problems in Africa. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;biofuel production;willingness pay;contract farming;public policy;SSA;environmental impact;large scale;policy maker;raw material;land use change;arable land;decision making;exchange rate;family farming;food security;short term;food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;long run;factor influencing;smallholder farmer;CC ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2009,,Emerging Topics in Macroeconomics,,,,,,,#36657,,"",""
"Making biodiversity-friendly cocoa pay: Combining yield, certification, and REDD for shade management","","Abstract: The twin United Nations' Millennium Development Goals of biodiversity preservation and poverty reduction both strongly depend on actions in the tropics. In particular, traditional agroforestry could be critical to both biological conservation and human livelihoods in human-altered rainforest areas. However, traditional agroforestry is rapidly disappearing, because the system itself is economically precarious, and because the forest trees that shade traditional crops are now perceived to be overly detrimental to agricultural yield. Here, we show a case where the commonly used agroforestry shade metric, canopy cover, would indeed suggest complete removal of shade trees to maximize yield, with strongly negative biodiversity and climate implications. However, a yield over 50% higher was achievable if approximately 100 shade trees per hectare were planted in a spatially organized fashion, a win-win for biodiversity and the smallholder. The higher yield option was detected by optimizing simultaneously for canopy cover, and a second shade metric, neighboring tree density, which was designed to better capture the yield value of ecological services flowing from forest trees. Nevertheless, even a 50% yield increase may prove insufficient to stop farmers converting away from traditional agroforestry. To further increase agroforestry rents, we apply our results to the design of a sustainable certification (eco-labelling) scheme for cocoa-based products in a biodiversity hotspot, and consider their implications for the use of the United Nations REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) program in agroforestry systems. Combining yield boost, certification, and REDD has the potential to incentivize eco-friendly agroforestry and lift smallholders out of poverty, simultaneously. ### Programs found: forest degradation program;program agroforestry system (AFS) ### Topics keywords: land use change;cover crop;developing country;eco friendly;CC;united nation;rural household;soil organic carbon;protected area;MT;agroforestry system;REDD;FAO;AFS;sustainable agriculture;NT;poverty reduction",2015,,Ecological Applications,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1890/13-0313.1.sm,,#36504,,"",""
Management and production practices in family systems of caprine breeding in the arid ravines of Jujuy and Salta [Prácticas de manejo y producción en sistemas familiares de cría caprina en las quebradas áridas de Jujuy y Salta],"","Abstract: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 40 family farming units (FFU) from the Quebradas of Humahuaca and Toro of Jujuy and Salta provinces, with the aim of describing production practices in their goat flocks. Farmers were subjected to an ad hoc survey to gather data on general management and specific feeding, reproduction and health practices. Analysis of variance and the test of Tukey were used for statistical analyses. FFUs had on average 124.2 ± 102goats (not including kids), with 79,7% being does. Predominant biotypes were Criollo, Criollo-Anglo Nubian crosses and Criollo-Saanen crosses. FFU facilities were very poor and water availability was limited; facilities were mostly composed of corrals enclosed by logs or rocks and to a lesser extent by rhomboidal wire. Animals are extensively bred, with nocturnal enclosure, and flock feeding is based on grazing the hills or grazing the crops or their residues. The 96.2% of the FFU produce milk by handmilking method and an average yield of 0.59 ± 0.31 liters per goat. FFU milk production is devoted to the sale of cheese (92%) or internal consumption (8%). Meat production is dedicated to sale a minimum number of kids, wethers and adult goats (68%) or entirely to self-consumption. Breeding is continuous (64%) or stationed (36%) and average kidding is concentrated in three periods: April-June (46%), July-August (31.5%) and September-October (13.7%) when almost all the flock kids, and a second kidding that was in November-January (15.2%). The kidding goats per mating goats was 79.4 ±18% and the kid weaned rates per mating goat was 66.7 ±26 %. Mean annual perinatal mortality rate per flock was 16.5 ± 11.5%. The management of goats with little or no permanence on the mountains favored (p <0.03) milk production and weaning kids (p<0.09) per matting goats. The fixed mating time also improved (p <0.004) the weaning kid rate and decreased the (p<0.05) perinatal mortality. The 61.5% of FFUs provide all the flock with mineral-vitamin mixtures one (79%) or twice (19%) a year and only the 15.4% vaccinated against clostridium diseases. Farmers (923%) routinely treat all the flock against parasites in autumn and spring and of those, the 54.2% treat twice a year. The 71.8% of owners treated against lice. These results show the importance of carrying out and validate more specific studies on nutritional, reproductive and health management of flocks, as production constraints registered are important and with simple and appropriate practices for small-holders flocks would be possible to increase production and raise general welfare of farming families. ### Countries mentioned: Argentina ### Animal products search: meat;cheese ### Measurements for crops: cheese ### Measurements for interventions: milk production ### Topics keywords: ANOVA;significant difference;analysis variance;crop residue;statistical analysis;family farming ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Revista de Investigaciones Agropecuarias,,,,,,,#36955,,"",""
"Microphytic crusts, shrub patches and water harvesting in the Negev Desert: the Shikim system.","","Abstract: Human-made contour banks are a central component of the Shikim water harvesting system in Israel's Negev Desert. Efficient water capture depends on the presence of a stable microphytic crust which directs surplus surface runoff into the banks where it is stored. We used simulated rainfall to examine the impact of soil surface disturbance on runoff and sediment transport, and the effect of this on the efficiency of resource capture within the Shikim system. Two disturbance regimes: (1) removal of the microphytic crust only, and (2) removal of the crust and shrub patches by cultivation, were compared with an undisturbed control. In the undisturbed state, 32% of rainfall was redistributed as runoff. This runoff penetrated approximately 27% deeper under the shrub patches compared with the microphytic crust. When the microphytic crust was destroyed by simulated trampling, the runoff coefficient declined to 13%, and there was no significant difference in water penetration between shrub and crust patches. Complete destruction of the shrub hummocks and crust by cultivation resulted in a decline in the runoff coefficient to 6%. The result of sustained disturbance in these patchy Negev shrublands is a breakdown in spatial heterogeneity, a loss of ecosystem function, a reduction in ecosystem goods and services such as plant diversity and production, and ultimately a reduction in pastoral productivity. These results reinforce the view that microphytic crusts are critical for the efficient operation of the Shikim water harvesting system. Given that practices such as cultivation and trampling which disturb microphytic crusts result in enhanced infiltration, crusts should be left intact to maximize the water harvesting efficiency in these desert landscapes. ### Countries mentioned: Israel ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;ecosystem service;sediment transport;ecosystem function;significant difference;surface runoff ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2002,,Landscape Ecology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1021575503284,,#36392,,"",""
Mineral contents and their interrelationships in soil-forage system along a transhumant route of nomadic pastoralists in Southern Nigeria.,"","Abstract: A study was undertaken to determine the mineral status of selected soils and forage along a transhumant route of nomadic pastoralists in the derived savanna of Southern Nigeria. The interrelationships among nutrients in the soil-forage system were also determined. Thus, soil and forage samples were collected along the route at the same time. The forage sampled were and . The soils ranged from acid to slightly alkaline. Some of the soil constituents showed significant relationships with one another. Phosphorus (P) and sodium (Na) contents of the forages, based on established critical levels were sufficient for ruminant animal production. The concentration of iron (Fe) in the forages was low in some of the locations while crude protein (CP), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and zinc (Zn) contents were inadequate. A few minerals in the soil showed significant relationships with those in the forage tissue. Consequently, it was concluded that since correlation coefficients between soil and plant tissue were low, prediction of mineral status of forage by regression analysis from mineral content of soil is likely to remain imperfect. However, arising from the deficiencies of certain minerals in the forages, there is need to supplement grazing animals along the route for increased productivity. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Programs found: consumer program (CP);community project (CP) ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;EC;cropping system;drinking water;dry matter;carbon pool;factor affecting;bulk density;regression analysis;cropping practice;BMP;sample collected;flow rate;centrifugal pump;DDT;DM;conservation practice;soil organic carbon;heavy metal;management practice;CP;cover crop;spatial distribution;trace element;crude protein;CC ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2002,,Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1081/CSS-120004826,,#36536,,"",interventions; livestock
"Mitigating the Water Footprint of Export Cut Flowers from the Lake Naivasha Basin, Kenya","","Abstract: Kenya's cut-flower industry has been praised as an economic success as it contributed an annual average of US$ 141 million foreign exchange (7 % of Kenyan export value) over the period 1996-2005 and about US$ 352 million in 2005 alone. The industry also provides employment, income and infrastructure such as schools and hospitals for a large population around Lake Naivasha. On the other hand, the commercial farms have been blamed for causing a drop in the lake level, polluting the lake and for possibly affecting the lake's biodiversity. The objective of this study is to quantify the water footprint within the Lake Naivasha Basin related to cut flowers and analyse the possibility to mitigate this footprint by involving cut-flower traders, retailers and consumers overseas. The water footprint of one rose flower is estimated to be 7-13 litres. The total virtual water export related to export of cut flowers from the Lake Naivasha Basin was 16 Mm 3/yr during the period 1996-2005 (22 % green water; 45 % blue water; 33 % grey water). Our findings show that, although the decline in the lake level can be attributed mainly to the commercial farms around the lake, both the commercial farms and the smallholder farms in the upper catchment are responsible for the lake pollution due to nutrient load. The observed decline in the lake level and deterioration of the lake's biodiversity calls for sustainable management of the basin through pricing water at its full cost and other regulatory measures. Pricing water at full marginal cost is important, but the conditions in Kenya are unlikely to result in serious steps to full-cost pricing, since many farmers resist even modest water price increases and government is lacking means of enforcement. We propose an alternative in this study that can be implemented with a focus on sustainable water use in flower farming around Lake Naivasha alone. The proposal involves a water-sustainability agreement between major agents along the cut-flower supply chain and includes a premium to the final product at the retailer end of the supply chain. Such a 'water sustainability premium' will raise awareness among flower consumers and-when channelled back to the farmers-facilitate the flower farms to install the necessary equipment and implement the right measures to use water in a sustainable manner. The collected premiums will generate a fund that can be used for financing measures to reduce the water footprint and to improve watershed management. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: cut flowers ### Measurements for crops: cut flowers ### Measurements for interventions: water footprint ### Topics keywords: EC;water saving;supply chain;LCA;final product;SC;water footprint;raw material ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,Water Resources Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0099-9,,#36303,,"",""
"Investigation of infectious reproductive pathogens of large ruminants: Are neosporosis, brucellosis, leptospirosis and BVDV of relevance in Lao PDR?","","Abstract: N. caninum, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, Brucella abortus and Leptospira interrogans serovar Hardjo are globally significant reproductive pathogens that cause abortion and reproductive loss in large ruminants. Prevalence information is lacking in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) despite the poor reproductive performance of cattle and buffalo. Serological examination of frozen cattle (n = 90) and buffalo (n = 61) sera by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays provided the first reported screening of some of these pathogens in Laos. Seroprevalence differed amongst these large ruminant species, with N. caninum, BVDV and L. interrogans serovar Hardjo antibodies found in 68.9% (95% CI +/- 11.6), 4.9% (95% CI +/- 5.4) and 3.3% (95% CI +/- 4.5) of buffalo sera, respectively, and in 7.8% (95% CI +/- 5.5), 10.0% (95% CI +/- 6.2) and 22.2% (95% CI +/- 8.6) of cattle sera, respectively. Buffalo sera had a significantly higher seroprevalence of N. caninum compared to cattle (p < 0.001) and cattle sera had a significantly higher seroprevalence of L. interrogans serovar Hardjo compared to buffalo (p = 0.003). Variability was also observed across provinces for N. caninum in buffalo (p = 0.007) and for L. interrogans serovar Hardjo in cattle (p = 0.071), suggesting provincial risk factors conducive to pathogen transmission. BVDV and N. caninum seropositivity were negatively associated in buffalo (p = 0.018) and cattle (p = 0.003). In buffalo, L interrogans serovar Hardjo and BVDV seropositivity were associated (p = 0.035, p = 0.039). The identification of antibodies against three major abortifacient pathogens in Laos prompts further research to determine if infection is associated with low reproductive efficiency and the risk factors for infection. This is needed for the development of evidence based prevention strategies for improved large ruminant reproductive management among smallholders in Laos. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Lao People's Democratic Republic ### Programs found: community initiative (CI) ### Topics keywords: calving interval;dairy cow;reproductive performance;NH4;NO3;dairy cattle;confidence interval;confidence interval CI;CI ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2018,,ACTA TROPICA,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.10.007,,#36243,,"",""
Land cover mapping at sub-pixel scales using linear optimization techniques.,"","Abstract: Mixed pixels result when the sensor's instantaneous field-of-view includes more than one land cover class on the ground. For mixed pixels, fuzzy classifiers can be used, which assign a pixel to several land cover classes in proportion to the area of the pixel that each class covers. These fraction values can be assigned to sub-pixels, based on the assumption of spatial dependence and the application of linear optimization techniques. A newly proposed sub-pixel mapping algorithm was first applied to a synthetic data set, a large artificial water reservoir (Lake Maga), with a 1-km resolution, derived from a 20-m resolution image. This algorithm yielded land cover maps at 500, 200, and 100 m resolution with accuracies close to 89%. Subsequent mode filtering further increased these values. The accuracy reached 78% when applied to a real data set, the Logone floodplain situated in Lake Chad basin and which stretches from Nigeria across northern Cameroon to Chad (Africa) with wetland vegetation consisting mainly of different species of grasses that have adapted to varying degrees of inundation ( and in shallows, and in deep water) and natural dryland vegetation consisting of woodland savanna, but now largely replaced by small-scale agriculture and grassy areas with thorny shrubs. While this study suggests the potential of the proposed technique, there is still ample scope for improvements and extensions. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Cameroon;Chad ### Topics keywords: small scale;land cover map;land cover;land cover class;NDVI ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2002,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(01)00242-5,,#37547,,"",""
Local Experiences in Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT): The Case of the West Kano Scheme in Kenya,"","Abstract: The paradigm of the public management of irrigation infrastructure and services has failed in developing countries. Currently, there is a general tendency to transfer the management of such infrastructure and services to local farmer organizations (also known as water user associations) in an exercise technically known as irrigation management transfer (IMT). As these transfers take place in different parts of the developing world, it becomes imperative to look at how the new management model is being implemented on the ground and compare the different experiences. This paper contributes the experience of the West Kano Irrigation Scheme in Kenya where the implementation of IMT is found to have buoyed up the morale of farmers. But in terms of performance, the model is not working perfectly owing to the lack of a clear policy framework, high water costs and environmental challenges. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: small scale;developing country;FO;water saving;developing world;RO;irrigation scheme ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2016,,Irrigation and Drainage,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ird.1995,,#36538,,"",interventions
Long-term effect of rice-based farming systems on soil health,"","Abstract: Integrated rice–fish culture, an age-old farming system, is a technology which could produce rice and fish sustainably at a time by optimizing scarce resource use through complementary use of land and water. An understanding of microbial processes is important for the management of farming systems as soil microbes are the living part of soil organic matter and play critical roles in soil C and N cycling and ecosystem functioning of farming system. Rice-based integrated farming system model for small and marginal farmers was established in 2001 at Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, Odisha. The different enterprises of farming system were rice–fish, fish–fingerlings, fruits, vegetables, rice–fish refuge, and agroforestry. This study was conducted with the objective to assess the soil physicochemical properties, microbial population, carbon and nitrogen fractions, soil enzymatic activity, and productivity of different enterprises. The effect of enterprises induced significant changes in the chemical composition and organic matter which in turn influenced the activities of enzymes (urease, acid, and alkaline phosphatase) involved in the C, N, and P cycles. The different enterprises of long-term rice-based farming system caused significant variations in nutrient content of soil, which was higher in rice–fish refuge followed by rice–fish enterprise. Highest microbial populations and enzymatic properties were recorded in rice–fish refuge system because of waterlogging and reduced condition prolonged in this system leading to less decomposition of organic matter. The maximum alkaline phosphatase, urease, and FDA were observed in rice–fish enterprise. However, highest acid phosphatase and dehydrogenase activity were obtained in vegetable enterprise and fish–fingerlings enterprise, respectively. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: rice;fruit vegetables;fruits ### Animal products search: fish ### Topics keywords: chemical composition;DM;OM;NH4;essential oil;IFS;NO3;farming system;organic matter;long term;SOM ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4518-2,,#37141,,"",""

Mechanization for harvesting and processing dryland plants.,"","Abstract: Agricultural mechanization in Mexico still ranges from hand tools, tools for draught animals to mechanized equipment. Agricultural production concentrates on cereals for domestic consumption, where big machines, tillage tools, planters, fertilization and spraying equipment have reached a high level of development. At present the mechanization index is 0.443 kW/ha of energy applied on farming activities for commercial agriculture. Two thirds of the Mexican territory is semiarid, where successful agriculture depends on low, seasonal and variable rainfall. Raising and processing of non-traditional plants in these regions is an alternative for poor farmers to increase their income, however, it requires adequate mechanization tools and techniques depending on yield and quality demands. Some of these products are cactus pear fruit ('tunas' ), lechuguilla to obtain fibres and 'maguey' molasses to produce liquors. However, to harvest and process them to a suitable standard quality, a lot of labour and hard work are required, and despite these, profit is still marginal. This work presents an analysis where research is being undertaken to supply to farmers with unsophisticated equipment and improved techniques for harvesting and industrializing these plants. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico ### Plant products search: pome fruits;cereals ### Measurements for interventions: commercial agriculture;mechanization ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;smallholder farmer;developing country ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2004,,Journal of Food,,,,,,,#36880,,"",""
Participatory action research (PAR) as an entry point for supporting climate change adaptation by smallholder farmers in Africa,"","Abstract: Emerging trends of a changing and increasingly variable climate have introduced new livelihood challenges in rain-fed smallholder agricultural systems that predominate in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The capacity of local farming communities and their institutions to respond to the new and emerging impacts of climate change is often constrained by lack of access to information and improved technologies, as well as poor support mechanisms to promote assimilation of new knowledge. This threatens to heighten vulnerability of the majority of SSA's rural communities who are already facing severe problems of food insecurity and a declining soil resource base. In this paper we use two case studies from Wenchi district in Ghana and Makoni in Zimbabwe to communicate how participatory action research (PAR) methodology, characterised by iterative planning-action-reflection cycles, was coupled with a new concept of field-based farmer learning centres to build adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to climate change. The study was part of a University of Zimbabwe-led project supported under the Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) programme to explore the state of resilience in African smallholder farming. The PAR and learning centre processes enabled communities, local leaders, and extension agents and researchers to establish the, hither to, imperceptible link between poor soil fertility and rising institutional challenges within communities. Institutional conflicts related to land tenure and sharecropping arrangements between migrant farmers and native landowners were addressed in Ghana, while local institutions supporting traditional social safety net mechanisms were revitalized in Zimbabwe. In both cases, it was apparent that farmers faced multiple stresses, at the core of which were poor and declining soil fertility and weakening local institutions. The worsening rainfall distribution and increasing cases of drought are broadening the scope for vulnerability, often driving competing claims and conflicts. PAR was successfully used as an entry point, empowering communities to self-mobilize and self-organize to co-learn and experiment with integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies and other improved farming practices. They realised opportunities for achieving high crop yields and generate surpluses in good years. Strengthening local institutional capacity to revitalise community safety nets proved an essential ingredient for enhancing adaptive capacity of smallholders to climatic shocks. The PAR process was a major driver of effective partnerships among community members, extension, policy makers and researchers, but ensuing success generated a new set of social challenges that could not be addressed within the short timescale of the project. We conclude that PAR was a suitable mechanism for supporting self-organization and co-learning processes among smallholder farmers and their service providers, enabling them to use ISFM technologies and strengthen their local institutions around natural resource management. This revealed the scope for building adaptive capacity of these communities against climate change and variability. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe;Ghana ### Programs found: short timescale project;led project;climate change adaptation (CCAA) program;zimbabwe led project ### Topics keywords: integrated soil fertility;organic farming;natural resource;land degradation;soil fertility;rural community;willingness pay;contract farming;CC;adaptive capacity;SSA;smallholder farming;farming practice;farming system;ICT;policy maker;natural resource management;land reform;decision making;land tenure;social capital;climate change adaptation;management practice;extension agent;food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;among smallholder farmer;extension service;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);BLEND;IDA",2013,,Environmental Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2012.11.001,,#37546,,"",interventions; livestock

Leaf area index and root biomass variation at different secondary forest ages in the eastern Amazon.,"","Abstract: In the Amazon region, small farmers use secondary forests as the only source of nutrients for agriculture, performing slash and burn in a rotation system. Secondary forests cover a large area of these landscapes and are crucial to maintaining soil fertility. The main objectives of this study were to gain insight into the seasonal variations in leaf area index (LAI) and root biomass growth, and to improve the accuracy of carbon sequestration estimates in early successional tropical secondary forests following shifting cultivation. Secondary vegetation of three different ages (1 year, 6 years and 10 years after shifting cultivation) were monitored monthly with a LI-COR Plant Canopy Analyzer, and root growth was seasonally measured down to a depth of 400 cm using ingrowth bags. The youngest secondary forests showed strong LAI seasonality, and the seasonality in LAI decreased in the oldest forest. The roots grew throughout the year even though the growth rates were higher during the dry season, which supported a dense biomass of leaves over the year. This study clearly indicates that information on deep rooting and seasonality of leaf area in secondary tropical forests is essential for understanding ecosystem ecophysiology, as well as community ecology and biogeochemical cycles. ### Topics keywords: land degradation;soil fertility;carbon sequestration;sweet potato;land cover;forest cover;shifting cultivation;dry season;agroforestry system;small scale;land use change;oil palm;tropical forest;soil organic carbon;secondary forest;protected area;dairy cattle;ecosystem service;food insecurity;spatial distribution;land use;specie richness;crop residue;human activity",2017,,Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2017.05.033,,#37261,,"",""
"Companies and squatting in the western division of New South Wales, 1896-1905.","","Abstract: For a decade of drought in varying degrees, the financial outcomes of a group of sheep grazing properties are studied. All properties were under the control of one or other of five large pastoral broking companies. Despite the capital losses sustained over the period, there was an almost continuous ability demonstrated to more than cover cash running costs on the part of some stations at least. This resulted partly from increasing the rate of sale of livestock over'normal' disposals. This may be regarded as capital disinvestment, but was an essential reorganization of the properties subsequent to their previous overstocked condition and the ravages of rabbits. Rising wool prices and increased yields per sheep, combined with internal economics of scale due to property amalgamation, also help to explain this phenomenon.

"<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">The Research and Experimental Record of the Ministry of Agriculture</i>, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Northern Ireland</i>.","","Abstract: : In long-term experiments on the control of cabbage root fly in spring-planted cauliflowers the final yields from all the insecticide treatments were significantly higher than those from the controls, although dieldrin-dipped plants gave lower yields than those collar-dusted with BHC or aldrin and those raised in treated seed-beds and subsequently root-washed. More noteworthy, however, was the precocity of the plants from BHC-treated seed-beds which produced marketable heads considerably earlier than the others. Top growth in narcissus bulbs was almost completely inhibited following 3 hours' treatment in hot water containing an organo-mercury fungicide followed by a cold dip in dieldrin to control the narcissus flies, and formaldehyde is therefore considered to be a more suitable fungicide. The incidence of big bud in black currants was reduced from 33.6 to 10.7 % by applications of 0.04% endrin and from 23 to 12.7% by 5% refined petroleum oil. : Trials of fungicides for the control of rose diseases continued, the best results in 1958 being obtained with Fermate plus Spersul and oil-bordeaux followed by Fernide. : Demonstration plots of black currants have been kept weed-free for 2 years by chemical means alone with no crop injury, perennial grasses and buttercups having been eradicated by 2 applications of 7.5 lb. a.e. of dalapon plus 2 lb. of MCPA per acre and the ground subsequently kept clear with 2, 4-DES, CIPC and fenuron. Fairly good control of annual meadow grass and buttercups among raspberries was obtained with 3.75 lb. a.e. of dalapon plus 2 lb. of MCPA per acre, and a combination spray of 4 lb. of 2, 4-DES plus fenuron at 0.25 or 0.5 lb. per acre eliminated weeds and did not affect the final yield. Directed sprays of dalapon at 3.75 lb. a.e., MCPA at 2 lb., CIPC at 3 lb. and fenuron at 0.5 lb. per acre caused no injury to gooseberries, when applied in various combinations in January and May, and gave good weed control. Strawberries were tolerant of CIPC only when applied during dormancy, whereas their tolerance of a mixture of 4 lb. of 2, 4-DES plus 0. 5 lb. of fenuron appeared to increase during the season. A wide range of apple varieties was unaffected by the application of dalapon at 7.5 lb. a.e. per acre, but couch grass recovered, and repeated application at lower rates is suggested. Amino-triazole at 10 lb. per acre kept the ground practically free from all weeds except horsetail. Simazine, as a directed pre-emergence spray in July, completely controlled weeds for the rest of the season among roses. Tomato plants irradiated from mercury vapour lamps for 21 days as seedlings started cropping 4 days earlier and gave a 28.2% increase in yield in the 1st month and 10.4% more total crop.

Cultivation and nutritive value oï the fodder mallow.,"","Abstract: Kahsnitz's account of the testing of Lampe's fodder mallow in Pomerania is supplemented by a report of results obtained in similar trials at the Experimental Station, Rostock, and at the Plant Breeding Institute, Giessen. . Kahsnitz's findings concerning the necessity for shallow and not too early sowing (Geith recommends the beginning to the middle of May, in accordance with climate and soil) and concerning the heavy water requirements of the mallow are fully confirmed. Whether water is supplied in the form of precipitation or by a relatively high water table appears to be more or less immaterial. The unsuitability of the plant for use in light land is also confirmed. Higher protein content was obtained in good soil. Yield of green weight varied considerably; it reached approximately 350 to 400 dz. per hectare when the soil was well limed and bulk was encouraged by the liberal application of N. The figures obtained for chemical composition by Sessous at Giessen are quoted, and show the value of the mallow as a furnisher of protein. . Experiments in haymaking resulted in an average loss of 50 per cent of the nutrients, especially protein, even when the greatest care was exercised. The growing of mallows for hay is therefore not recommended. Trials of ensilage resulted in the production of a useful, though not uniformly palatable fodder. It is considered, however, that there is room for further experimentation here. The crop is not yet beyond the experimental stage, but trials on a small scale by farmers have confirmed the findings of the Experiment Stations.-G.M.R. ### Countries mentioned: Germany ### Plant products search: citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: small scale;nitrogen fertilizer;chemical composition;DM;NH4;nutritive value;essential oil;dry matter;NO3;extension service;protein content;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1936,,Mitteilungen fur die Landwirtschaft,,,,,,,#37158,,"",""
An economic comparison of traditional and conventional agricultural systems at a county level.,"","Abstract: In Holmes and Wayne Counties (Ohio, USA) respectively, one-half and one-fourth of the farms belong to the Amish, an agrarian culture whose traditional agriculture has been remarkably successful. In an analysis of the 88 Ohio counties by means of the federal agricultural census, the economic performance of the 2 counties was examined in graphs of agricultural characteristics and financial indicators, some expressed on a per-hectare basis across total farmland, as a measure of the efficiency of land utilization. Their performance was assessed relative to the following 3 groups of Ohio counties with high per-hectare net farm income: those with large mean farm size, a prevalence of nursery and greenhouse production, or mixed crop and livestock agriculture. Belonging to the latter group, Holmes County ranked 10th and 13th highest among Ohio counties in per-hectare gross and net farm income, respectively, and Wayne County, 5th and 6th. Despite the small mean farm size of 50 and 62 ha for Holmes and Wayne Counties, respectively, they matched counties of large mean farm size in terms of per-hectare net farm income, and among 22 counties with small mean farm size of about 60 ha or less, they were exceeded only by 3 counties based on intensive nursery and greenhouse production. The large incomes were due to high marketed value of animal products. Supplemental feed consumption was 2.0 and 1.3 times the harvested crop production in Holmes and Wayne Counties, respectively, thus indicating large net imports of purchased feed. The large net incomes for the 2 counties were also a result of low labour costs, partly due to the fact that the Amish do not charge for helping each other on farms. When a conventional charge was applied to Amish labour, Wayne County remained among the highest of Ohio counties in per-hectare net farm income, but Holmes County dropped to near the 50th percentile. Nonetheless, for the same decline, Holmes County remained among the highest of the 22 counties of small mean farm size because its initial performance was well above most of these counties. Since this was a study of land use efficiency, some discussion is devoted to farm size and productivity, relative levels of animal production, and cropland requirements to power horses, and biofuelled mechanical traction, the former an integral component of Amish agriculture. In the latter topic, maize-based ethanol and horse feed would require roughly the same area of cropland for traction to farm the nation's cropland, but on a net energy basis, the former area would be more than twice the latter. Since animal production is a major component of Amish agriculture, the results of the study provide indirect evidence that the small-scale, traditional farming of the Amish contributes substantially to the agricultural economies of Holmes and Wayne Counties. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Plant products search: maize ### Measurements for interventions: purchased feed;farm income;net farm income;crop production ### Topics keywords: small scale;net income;net energy;land use;use efficiency;energy consumption;economic benefit;farm size ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2001,,American Journal of Alternative Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0889189300008808,,#37440,,"",""
Long-term farming systems research in the central High Plains.,"","Abstract: In recent decades, there has been growing interest among farming and scientific communities toward integrated crop-range-livestock farming because of evidence of increased crop production, soil health, environmental services and resilience to increased climatic variability. This paper reviews studies on existing cropping systems and integrated crop-range-livestock systems across the USA which are relevant in the context of summarizing opportunities and challenges associated with implementing long-term crop-range-livestock systems research in the highly variable environment of the central High Plains. With precipitation ranging from 305 to 484 mm and uncertain irrigation water supply, this region is especially vulnerable to changing moisture and temperature patterns. The results of our review indicate that diverse crop rotations, reduced soil disturbance and integrated crop-livestock systems could increase economic returns and agroecosystem resilience. Integrating agricultural system components to acquire unique benefits from small- to medium-sized operations, however, is a challenging task. This is because assessment and identification of suitable farming systems, selection of the most efficient integration scheme, and pinpointing the best management practices are crucial for successful integration of components. Effective integration requires development of evaluation criteria that incorporate the efficiency of approaches under consideration and their interactions. Therefore, establishing the basis for more sustainable farming systems in the central High Plains relies on both long-term agricultural systems research and evaluation of short-term dynamics of individual components. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;cropping system;agro ecosystem;livestock farming;point view;BMP;pest control;farming system;beef cattle;long term;crop rotation;animal health;management practice;animal husbandry;short term;crop residue;dairy farming;best management practice;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2013,,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170512000208,,#37543,,"",""
Integrating spatial continuous wavelet transform and normalized difference vegetation index to map the agro-pastoral transitional zone in Northern China,"","Abstract: The agro-pastoral transitional zone (APTZ) in Northern China is one of the most important ecological barriers of the world. The commonly-used method to identify the spatial distribution of ATPZ is to apply a threshold rule on climatic or land use indicators. This approach is highly subjective, and the quantity standards vary among the studies. In this study, we adopted the spatial continuous wavelet transform (SCWT) technique to detect the spatial fluctuation in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) sequences, and as such identify the APTZ. To carry out this analysis, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI 1-month data (MODND1M) covering the period 2006-2015 were used. Based on the spatial variation in NDVI, we identified two sub-regions within the APTZ. The temporal change of APTZ showed that although vegetation spatial pattern changed annually, certain areas appeared to be stable, while others showed higher sensitivity to environmental variance. Through correlation analysis between the dynamics of APTZ and precipitation, we found that the mean center of the APTZ moved toward the southeast during dry years and toward the northwest during humid years. By comparing the APTZ spatial pattern obtained in the present study with the outcome following the traditional approach based on mean annual precipitation data, it can be concluded that our study provides a reliable basis to advance the methodological framework to identify accurately transitional zones. The identification framework is of high importance to support decision-making in land use management in Northern China as well as other similar regions around the world. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;MODIS;VI;spatial distribution;land use;NDVI;spatial pattern;vegetation index;decision making;spatial variation;normalized difference vegetation index ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2018,,Remote Sensing,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10121928,,#36574,,"",""
Kuwait: small-scale agriculture in an oil economy.,"","Abstract: Agriculture in Kuwait contributes less than 1% of GDP and employs only 1% of the workforce. The comparatively insignificant role it plays in the economy is related to a number of environmental constraints, including limited water resources, a harsh climatic regime and poor soils, as well as to difficulties of an inexperienced and poorly trained labour force, low productivity per worker employed and the ease with which Kuwait can pay for food imports. There are two other major obstacles to agricultural development: (1) all Kuwaitis are guaranteed a white collar job by the Government and are not generally interested in agriculture; and (2) any large scale agricultural expansion would have to be underpinnd by imports of new sweet water supplies from Iraq which are not currently feasible. ### Countries mentioned: Iraq;Kuwait ### Topics keywords: small scale;GDP;factor influencing;large scale;gross domestic product ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",1985,,Agricultural development in the Middle East,,,,,,,#36586,,"",""
Land conflicts between smallholders and Fulani pastoralists in Ghana: Evidence from the Asante Akim North District (AAND),"","Abstract: Following the recent evolution in the demand for land due to population growth and urbanisation in Africa, there are rising contestations and conflicts over the ownership, access and use of customary land. The situation intensifies with increasing land values and scarcity as a result of commoditisation, individualisation and commercialisation of land within a new era of '. land grabbing'. Using qualitative data from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, this paper examined the land tenure system in the Asante Akim North District of Ghana, and how it influences conflicts between Fulani pastoralists and smallholder farmers. The study found that despite a strong customary land tenure regime in Ghana, value-driven land market transactions have triggered conflicts between smallholders and Fulani herders. Conflicts with Fulani herders are largely linked to crop and water bodies' destruction, but underneath these is the citizenship construction of pastoralists. Conflicts in Agogo are therefore to some extent embedded in ethnicity because farmers construct Fulani identity as non-Ghanaian. There is also widespread perception by community members that chiefs sell lands indiscriminately and are corrupt. These perceptions have future implications for land conflicts. Hence, there is the need for more clarity in common property laws and deepened community consultations regarding stool land administration. There is also the need for approaches that promote improved win-win outcomes for both herders and smallholders. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;water body;land reform;land grabbing;land degradation;land cover;risk assessment;BMP;large scale;land tenure;smallholder farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2015,,Journal of Rural Studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.009,,#36190,,"",""

Methods for estimating reference evapotranspiration influence of the São Francisco River transposition.,"","Abstract: Among the methods available for measuring reference evapotranspiration, the Penman-Monteith-FAO is considered the most accurate. However, it is an expensive method to be used because many meteorological variables are required and agrometeorological stations are costly. On the other hand, there are other methods available that require less data and, consequently, offer a cheaper technique to obtain reference evapotranspiration data, an important condition for small farmers who use irrigation systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the following methods: Hargreaves-Samani, Thornthwaite-48, modified Thornthwaite, Camargo-71, Blaney-Criddle, Jensen-Haise, Radiation FAO 24, Aerodynamic and Energy balance, in order to estimate reference evapotranspiration in the area of influence of the São Francisco River Transposition. The meteorological data covered the period from 1995 to 2014. The performance of the Hargreaves-Samani method was rated as ""great"" and was consistent throughout the studied area. Because this method requires only air temperature data, it can be recommended as an alternative for small farmers to estimate reference evapotranspiration in the studied area. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Topics keywords: air temperature;growing season;energy consumption;energy balance;FAO;reference evapotranspiration ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,Engenharia na Agricultura,,,,,https://doi.org/10.13083/reveng.v25i6.758,,#36492,,"",interventions; livestock
Measuring farmers' awareness and knowledge level about climate change and formulating future extension strategies.,"","Abstract: Climate change is being considered as a serious threat to the livelihood of Indian farmers. The increase in temperature, erratic rainfall, increased sea level, decreased snowfall etc. are affecting the production and productivity of different crop across the country. However, the farmers are very poorly informed about recent changes in climate and its impacts on agriculture. Successful adaptation depends on the scientific knowledge level of farmers and formulation of suitable extension strategies. The present study was conducted in Shimla and Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh to measure the knowledge and awareness level of farmers about climate change. Total 100 farmers were interviewed and information from different experts was collected for formulation of future extension strategies. The study revealed that only 22 per cent respondents knew about climate change in the area, while 43 per cent respondents had knowledge about the diverse human induced causes of climate change. The study reveals the low knowledge and awareness level of the sample which suggest need of intensive extension education programme for their capacity building and information empowerment. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Programs found: education program ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;cent respondent;dairy farming;CC ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Indian Research Journal of Extension Education,,,,,,,#37573,,"",interventions; livestock

A comprehensive insight into the geography of forest cover in Italy: Exploring the importance of socioeconomic local contexts,"","Abstract: Forest cover is a key attribute of local communities and affects the spatial organization of any given region. Changes in forest cover are influenced by spatially-varying biophysical and anthropogenic factors mainly associated with urban-rural, coastal-inland and elevation gradients. The present study investigates the relationship between the socioeconomic structure of local communities and selected indicators of forest landscape in Italy, including change in forest area over time (2000 - 2012), using an exploratory multivariate analysis based on principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering and discriminant analysis. We assess the importance of socio-spatial structures, economic dynamics and demographic patterns in the geography of forest cover, expansion and loss, considering 149 statistical indicators that are used to evaluate the multiple dimensions of sustainable development. The results point to agriculture, income, education arid labour market indicators as a key predictors of contexts with high forest cover and moderate changes in forest area (both gain and loss) from those with low forest cover and marked changes in forest area. High forest cover in rural districts was spatially associated with local communities featuring depopulation, unemployment, low educational levels and subsistence agriculture. These factors consolidate land abandonment and soil erosion. The highest rate of change in forest area was observed in economically-growing, accessible local contexts with dynamic socio-demographic profiles. Integrated environmental and socioeconomic policies for sustainable development are required to incorporate forest cover and changes in wooded area as pivotal variables and may benefit from a better understanding of the role of local communities in forest management. ### Countries mentioned: Italy ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;natural resource;land degradation;CA;rural community;factor affecting;principal component;land cover;land abandonment;forest cover;large scale;PCA;land use change;rural tourism;protected area;social capital;principal component analysis;spatial distribution;local community;trace element;sustainable development ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2016.11.008,,#37467,,"",""
A way forward on adaptation to climate change in Colombian agriculture: Perspectives towards 2050,"","Abstract: Policy measures regarding adaptation to climate change include efforts to adjust socio-economic and ecologic systems. Colombia has undertaken various measures in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation since becoming a party of the Kyoto protocol in 2001 and a party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. The first national communication to the UNFCCC stated how Colombian agriculture will be severely impacted under different emission scenarios and time frames. The analyses in this document further support that climate change will severely threaten the socioeconomics of Colombian agriculture. We first query national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector. We then use 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural production may be affected by climate change, and show the expected changes to years 2040-2069 (""2050"") under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100. We then evaluate expected changes within different regions and measure the proportion of area affected within each crop's distributional range. By 2050, climatic change in Colombia will likely impact 3. 5 million people, 14 % of national GDP corresponding to agriculture, employment of 21 % of the population, agro-industries, supply chains, and food and nutritional security. If no adaptation measures are taken, 80 % of crops would be impacted in more than 60 % of their current areas of cultivation, with particularly severe impacts in high value perennial and exportable crops. Impacts also include soil degradation and organic matter losses in the Andes hillsides; likely flooding in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts; niche losses for coffee, fruit, cocoa, and bananas; changes in prevalence of pests and diseases; and increases in the vulnerabilities of non-technically developed smallholders. There is, however, still time to change the current levels of vulnerability if a multidisciplinary focus (i. e., agronomic, economic, and social) in vulnerable sectors is undertaken. Each sub-sector and the Government need to invest in: (1) data collection, (2) detailed, regionally-based impact assessments, (3) research and development, and (4) extension and technology transfer. Support to vulnerable smallholders should be given by the state in the form of agricultural insurance systems contextualized under the phenomenon of climate change. A national coordination scheme led by (but not restricted to) the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) with the contributions of national and international institutions is needed to address agricultural adaptation. ### Countries mentioned: Colombia;Japan ### Plant products search: bananas ### Topics keywords: EC;GDP;IPCC;GHG emission;N2O;SC;united nation;DM;adaptation measure;climate change mitigation;adaptation climate change;soil organic carbon;ministry agriculture;climatic change;rural development;FAO;organic matter;cover crop;climate change;OM;supply chain;factor influencing;gross domestic product;CC ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",2012,,Climatic Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0500-y,,#37110,,"",""

An example of small farm response to the crisis in the traditional agricultural sector.,"","Abstract: The crisis of traditional agriculture in Spain is frequently stated to be the result of migration and the disparities between agricultural supply and demand which affect the large estates and small farmers in different ways. The common prescription for the crisis includes such measures as reform of inefficient structures, increased productivity and reorientation of supply. However such measures will not stop migration unless they are accompanied by an improvement in communal infrastructure. An area of typical peasant ('minifundio') farming in the province of Segovia has been surveyed to see how well it has achieved these aims. Data for consolidation of landholding, size of farms, irrigation, level of mechanization, products, and livestock numbers are provided for dates over the period 1964-1978. Also provided are some figures to indicate standards of living in the area (installation of central heating, hot water, bathrooms, etc. in homes). The results of the survey suggest that the development prescription has worked in the area studied: not only has the structure of farming changed but also higher value products are being produced and the value added of agricultural products is being increased by processing and marketing. ### Countries mentioned: Spain ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: value added;agro food;value chain;factor influencing ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1980,,Agricultura y Sociedad,,,,,,,#36264,,"",""
Annual Review and determination of guarantees 1968 in the UK.,"","Abstract: The Government's selective expansion programme provided that the Annual Review machinery be used both for surveying progress towards the expansion objectives of the industry and also for assessing the financial and physical resources required.

With such cost increases, the minimum statutory award permitted as a result of this year's Annual Review would amount to about £27 million. Actual farming net income in the farm year June 1967-May 1968 is forecast to be £510 million, an increase of £181/2 million over the figure of £491 1/2 million now estimated for 1966/67. This in turn was an increase of £28 million over the figure for 1965/66.

Assessing soil quality in areas affected by sulfide mining. Application to soils in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (SW Spain),"","Abstract: The characterization, evaluation and remediation of polluted soils is one of the present environmental challenges to be addressed in the coming years. The origin of trace elements in soils can be either geogenic or anthropogenic, but only the latter is interesting from a legal point of view. The hazard of the pollutants in the soils not only depends on their total concentration, but particularly on their availability. The mobility of the trace elements depends on their speciation, and it is also affected by several soil parameters. Mining activity is one of the most important anthropogenic causes of soil pollution. As a case study, this work is focused in the Riotinto mining area (Iberian Pyrite Belt, IPB, SW Spain). The IPB is one of the most important metallogenic provinces in the world and it has been exploited for thousands of years. The disposal of mining residues has produced important sources of contamination by trace elements and acidic waters affecting soils and rivers. In addition to these problems, the closure of mines in the Pyrite Belt at the end of the 20th Century has led to a great loss of employment, which has caused the development of an intensive agriculture of citrus fruits as a new source of income. The intensive growing of citrus fruits and the traditional subsistence agriculture have been developed surrounding the mining areas and on floodplains near to mining sites. The level of soil pollution has not been taken into account in these cases, nor has its impact on the health of the inhabitants of these areas. Therefore, it is of great interest to study the current state of the cultivated soils and the sources and types of contaminants derived from mining activity in order to program its decontamination, where appropriate, according to legislation. In order to know the present and future hazard posed by the soils chemical and mineralogical speciation has been carried out, given that the availability of a metal depends on the phase in which it is found. The results showed that mining activity has caused high levels of As, Cu, Pb and Zn in several cultivated soils. Moreover, Cu, Pb and Zn showed a high bioavailability. This suggests that at least other studies are necessary to preserve health in the inhabitants of this area. The methodology carried out in this work allowed to select potentially polluted areas where agricultural activities are not recommended. ### Countries mentioned: Spain ### Plant products search: citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: plant height;trace element;take account;winter wheat;TE;point view;taking account;taken account;seed weight;spring wheat;technical efficiency ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Minerals,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/min1010073,,#37276,,"",""
Beneficial impacts of climate change on pastoral and broadacre agriculture in cool-temperate Tasmania.,"","Abstract: Although geographically small, Tasmania has a diverse range of regional climates that are affected by different synoptic influences. Consequently, changes in climate variables and climate-change impacts will likely vary in different regions of the state. This study aims to quantify the regional effects of projected climate change on the productivity of rainfed pastoral and wheat crop systems at five sites across Tasmania. Projected climate data for each site were obtained from the Climate Futures for Tasmania project (CFT). Six General Circulation Models were dynamically downscaled to ∼10-km grid cells using the CSIRO Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model under the A2 emissions scenario for the period 1961-2100. Mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures at each site are projected to increase from a baseline period (1981-2010) to 2085 (2071-2100) by 2.3-2.7°C. Mean annual rainfall is projected to increase slightly at all sites. Impacts on pasture and wheat production were simulated for each site using the projected CFT climate data. Mean annual pasture yields are projected to increase from the baseline to 2085 largely due to an increase in spring pasture growth. However, summer growth of temperate pasture species may become limited by 2085 due to greater soil moisture deficits. Wheat yields are also projected to increase, particularly at sites presently temperature-limited. This study suggests that increased temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO concentrations are likely to increase regional rainfed pasture and wheat production in the absence of any significant changes in rainfall patterns. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Plant products search: wheat ### Programs found: effect project;annual rainfall (AR) project;tasmania project ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;CO;soil moisture;SM;CO2;CC ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Pasture Science;Crop &amp,,,,,,,#36971,,"",""

Animal welfare and animal rights groups are exerting pressure on intensive livestock industries such as poultry and pigs. Environmental concerns are emerging due to the traditional methods of disposing of farm waste. Issues range from surface and groundwater pollution and public health hazards to environmental degradation and quality of life concerns.

"Conservation for the long-haul: Protecting cultural and natural resources through financial, legal, and programmatic strategies","","Abstract: Historic Herff Farm in Boerne, Texas is an iconic Texas Hill Country landscape that has been carefully restored by the Cibolo Nature Center and Farm and is now being transformed into a center for sustainable living. In 2016, the farm was recognized with a Preservation Texas Honor Award, and the homestead is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A new Texas Historical Commission marker celebrates the life of the farm’s namesake, Dr. Ferdinand Ludwig von Herff, a prominent San Antonio physician who emigrated from Germany in the mid-1800s. Taking cues from its past, Herff Farm is a destination that currently hosts a weekly farmers market, “Farm Classroom” for schoolchildren in the area, with demonstrations showcasing best practices for water conservation, renewable energy and small-scale agricultural production. This paper highlights financial, legal and programmatic strategies that have been utilized to conserve the property in perpetuity. The Texas Historic Preservation Tax Credit was established by the Texas Legislature in 2015 for certified rehabilitation work on historically-designated properties and equals 25% of eligible costs and expenses. This is a valuable financial tool for owners and investors who wish to rehabilitate cultural treasures to the Standards of Rehabilitation of the Secretary of the Interior. The property has also been placed under a voluntary conservation easement, a legal agreement between the landowner and a land trust that limits the owner’s development rights in order to maintain its natural and cultural features. Finally, building public support by providing access, services and programs helps ensure a culture of stewardship and sense of ownership by the greater community. These strategies could be employed by conservation-minded landowners with limited resources who seek to preserve cultural and natural resources. ### Countries mentioned: Germany;United States ### Programs found: service program ### Topics keywords: small scale;natural resource;sustainable development;energy consumption;renewable energy;biogas production ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2495/SDP170361,,#36544,,"",""
Cultivable land worldwide not in cultivation: Sufficient land available for humanity's sustainable food security? [Les terres cultivables non cultivées dans le monde des disponibilités suffisantes pour la sécurité alimentaire durable de l'humanité?],"","Abstract: At the request of the French ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, a study was carried out in 2009 by Laurence Roudart on the current and future availability of cultivable land. The three databases she analysed indicates that the land area utilisable for rainfed cultivation (without need of irrigation) that is not yet being farmed is, globally, very extensive - particularly in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. On the other hand, this particular resource seems to be scarce or even to have been exhausted in the Middle East and Asia. Global warming would probably lead to a - small - increase in cultivable land, but would reduce the cultivable areas available in developing countries, particularly in South and South-East Asia, where such land is already a scarce resource. The world's cultivable areas seem greatly to exceed what is necessary to guarantee humanity's food security. This conclusion remains true even if we assume relatively low growth In agricultural yields along the lines of a ""sustainable, doubly green revolution"" and exclude from cultivation all the currently protected zones and the forests. It is true even if we take into account the plausible effects of global warming. However, the sustainable exploitation of cultivable land resources requires appropriate public policies on agricultural prices, on access to land, and on research-and-development targeted at the needs and potential of poor producers. ### Countries mentioned: France ### Topics keywords: take account;GHG emission;developing country;public policy;chemical fertilizer;SSA;environmental impact;point view;taking account;taken account;sustainable agriculture;LCA;CO2;FAO;family farming;food security;climate change;green revolution;smallholder farmer;global warming ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;East Asia and Pacific;Middle East and North Africa;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Futuribles: Analyse et Prospective,,,,,,,#36723,,"",""
Developing efficient beef production in Ireland.,"","Abstract: Cattle production for beef is a feature of the great majority of Irish farms, but farms solely or mainly devoted to cattle production are predominantly small, with 79% under 50 acres, and many are operated as part-time units. In order to be viable, a purely drystock farm, under average management and intensity of production, needs to be a minimum of 85 adjusted acres or 65 acres with drystock and tillage. However, with intensive production accompanied by good management the acreage threshold of viability can be lower. Smaller sized units would need to incorporate a high income generating enterprise such as dairying in order to become viable. However, cattle production has a greater potential for expansion of numbers than dairying. The levels of income being generated in cattle production are extremely variable but generally low. Low returns per animal unit makes loan repayment more difficult. Low margins from cattle production are due primarily to poor standards of animal performance and low stocking rates. This low physical performance is influenced not only by the general standards of grassland management, the inadequacy of winter feed and animal accommodation, but also by a lack of management information. Performance standards and wintering accommodation should be improved. Improvement in efficiency of cattle production will lead to an increasing requirement for calves, which could be forthcoming from existing dairy herds. The development of multiple suckling should be considered, especially for the many smaller farms unlikely to go into dairying. Development should be largely geared to improvement and intensification of existing systems. Development of integrated calf-to-beef systems should also be encouraged, because it can provide a reasonable income through a good technical management. Finally, small cattle units are important, both in terms of numbers and of land use and are likely to be a long-term feature of the Irish farming economy. They have generally not adopted silage making. The establishment of grassland management and conservation systems which will help them to develop their cattle production systems and make them more efficient is worthy of special consideration. ### Countries mentioned: Ireland ### Animal products search: beef ### Topics keywords: stocking rate;dairy cow;land use;dairy industry;dairy farm;dairy herd;dairy cattle;beef cattle;long term ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1978,,"Conference.

Drainage maintenance and reconstruction costs and benefits: a watershed analysis.,"","Abstract: Currently there is an absence of applied economic analysis relevant to policy decisions on public drainage maintenance and reconstruction investment. The research problem involves the identification and application of economic criteria to the drainage process in the Interlake area of Manitoiba. The shortcomings of resource modification.decisions based on single use concepts and the need for including pervasive drainage effects on the economy are outlined. A regression model, utilizing the important variables involved in drainage reclamation, accounts for the major portion of the variation in benefits among farms. Although a cost-benefit figure of 1: 6 is estimated, its interpretation is consitrained by the particular economic relationship investigated, the partial nature of the analysis and the desirability of the distribution of drainage benefits. Drainage is a means of distributing income to low income farmers even though large farms receive the greatest share of benefits.

East Kent Regional Planning Scheme. Preliminary Survey Prepared for the Joint Town Planning Committee of Local Authorities.,"","Abstract: i. Despite Professor Abercrombie's wide experience in the preparation of regional reports, he must have felt that the adequate presentation of the problems of East Kent would tax his abilities to their utmost. Realizing the magnitude of his task the author has secured the collaboration of a number of distinguished men whose special experience or local knowledge has added much to the value of the report. The opening section deals with the topography and geology of the district, which may be roughly defined as that part of Kent lying east of a line drawn from Whitstable to Sandgate. The importance of these aspects need hardly be emphasized in view of the fact that the anticipated development of the coal-field is the main reason for the preparation of the report. Plans and a good sectional diagram give a very clear impression of the geological formation with its coal-field shaped like the point of a spoon, its edges striking the coast line at Richborough and Shakespeare's Cliff and its point lying a few miles to the north-east of Canterbury. After this outline the report reviews (II) the agriculture and vegetation of the district; (III) its archaeological features; (IV) administrative divisions; (V) population, health, and housing, returning in section (VI) to the industrial survey, which is mainly devoted to the coal-field, though the ironstone beds towards Folkestone and other economic minerals come into account. The coal is found in a number of seams of high grade steam coal, in the case of many borings exceeding a total thickness of 40 feet in seams of over 2 feet. The coal is deep down, workable seams ranging from 1, 250 to 2, 800 feet in depth according to the locality, as the chalk formation averages some 1, 000 feet, and underlying this there are older beds varying greatly in thickness. The depth dictates one condition that may be regarded as advantageous, namely, that the pit heads will probably be some four miles apart and the country less wrecked in consequence. If the proposition is realized that the coal should be employed to produce electric power at the pit heads, there will be a further gain towards the preservation of the amenities of the district. That this is of the gravest importance, even from the economic standpoint alone, will be realized when we find that the sea coast towns which would be more or less affected by any untoward development have a rateable value of £1, 313, 162, which, capitalized at 20 years' purchase, gives a total of £26, 263, 240, while the assumed value of eighteen pits in full working does not exceed a capitalized rateable value of £2, 816, 400. As the report says: ""The coastal towns that encircle East Kent are at present its most considerable commercial asset. From Whitstable to Folkestone and Sandgate they form a series of seaside resorts of varied character which it would be difficult to surpass anywhere in these islands. It is therefore exceedingly important that nothing be allowed to destroy their value in the eyes of the Londoner, for whom, of course, they primarily exist. It would indeed be poor policy from the point of view of the ratepayers of East Kent if the increase in rateable value of coal area in the rural districts were counter-balanced by a decrease in the sea-coast towns. ""But without some say in the regional ordering of these about-to-be-industrialized rural districts, these towns would be at the mercy of influences beyond their control; if the industrial growth were of the old-fashioned, smoke-producing, country-destroying sort they would find one of their real attractions-the rural charabanc trips-gone; and even if the worst deformities of industrialism were avoided, they would not be secure without a regional plan, which promoted their interests as well as those of the coalfield. ""There is really no antagonism: forethought and care in zoning, road planning and the preservation of certain natural features are all that are required. These special features of the Regional Scheme should not interfere in any way with the development of the coalfield which, in fact, will in every way be advantaged by systematic planning."" In view of the importance of this comparison it has been brought forward from its position in the report where it is preceded by studies of (VII) communications; (VIII) open spaces; and (IX) Canterbury, Sandwich, and the old villages. This last section, as may be imagined, lends itself to illustration, and some attractive views are included both in this and in the following section on Seaside resorts. The second part of the report deals in outline with the probabilities for the future, including the general zoning of the area, seaport developments arid the distribution of population, the estimate being for a probable doubling of this. Here the proposal takes the form of some seven or eight subsidiary towns appropriately placed with respect to the coal industries and looking towards Canterbury as a cultural centre and towards the coast resorts for recreation. For these towns the density laid down is 12 houses to the acre: as they would be purely residential this is considered to be adequate. Other matters which come under review include improvements in road and rail communications, selection of open spaces, the methods of coal working with a view to eliminating smoke, water supply and drainage, electric power, small holdings, social and educational considerations, with a special claim for the establishment of a University at Canterbury, and methods of realization and administration.

Economic analysis of precision farming technologies at the farm level: Two german case studies,"","Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to evaluate the economic whole farm impact of the implementation of precision-farming technologies. Therefore, two farms were analyzed, which had implemented different precision agriculture technologies several years ago. The farms can be regarded as early adopters of precision agriculture technologies in two very different agricultural production areas. One of the two analyzed farms (1560 ha) is located in East Germany (Saxony-Anhalt), in a region with low annual rainfall and high fertile soils. In this farm nitrogen and potassium fertilizer applications, fungicides applications, and seeding are managed site-specifically following a mapping-approach, based on yield maps and aerial photographs. The other farm (150 ha) is located in Bavaria, in a region with high annual rainfall and comparatively fertile soils. In this farm the Yara-N-Sensor® is used for site-specific nitrogen management. The economic analysis is based on economic efficiency calculations for the implemented technologies, e.g., break-even-analysis and profit estimations. Furthermore, the two farmers were interviewed about the impact on their farm management and organization. The implementation of the technologies provided economic gains for both of the farms. While the implementation of the sensor-based technology had only moderate effects on the overall farm management, the implementation of the mapping based system resulted in a far-reaching reorganization of the farm.We conclude that a sensor-approach is easier to implement than a mapping approach. The implementation of a mapping-based site-specific management approach requires more skills, e.g., for analyzing site-specific data or creating application maps. Positive returns on the investments in the fertilizer technology can only be achieved when the technologies are used on sufficient acreage. This is easier to realize on big farms in eastern Germany or in terms of a collaborative use of the technologies than on comparatively small farms in southern Germany. However, in both regions we didn't find evidence that the innovation is adopted by neighboring farmers, which indicates that there are still considerable adoption constraints that limit the diffusion of precision farming technologies in Germany. ### Countries mentioned: Germany ### Topics keywords: site specific;NH4;NO3;precision farming;management practice;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2008,,"Agricultural Systems: Economics, Technology, and Diversity",,,,,,,#36506,,"",""
Farmers' suicides in Maharashtra.,"","Abstract: An agrarian crisis has precipitated a spate of suicides in Maharashtra, India. The suicide mortality rate for farmers in the state has increased from 15 in 1995 to 57 in 2004. The rain-dependent cotton growing farmers of Vidarbha are faced with declining profitability because of dumping in the global market by the USA, low import tariffs, failure of the Monopoly Cotton Procurement Scheme and withdrawal of the state (resulting in declining public investment in agriculture, poor government agriculture extension services and the diminishing role of formal credit institutions). The farmer now depends on the input dealer for advice, leading to supplier-induced demand, and on informal sources of credit, which result in a greater interest burden. In short, the farmer is faced with yield, price, credit, income and weather uncertainties. It is argued that the way out is to merge bold public policy initiatives with civil society engagement. ### Countries mentioned: India;United States ### Plant products search: cotton ### Programs found: policy initiative;public policy initiative ### Topics keywords: contract farming;public policy;family farming;extension service ### Geo regions: South Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2006,,Economic and Political Weekly,,,,,,,#37415,,"",""
Fish farming of Pangasiids.,"","Abstract: For the last 15 years South East Asian fish farming of Pangasiids has shown dramatic growth and expansion. A main contributor in this field, Vietnam is the perfect example of a country having displayed a dynamics combining technical improvement derived from development oriented research, adaptability of culture systems and targeting of international markets. In Indonesia, following the example of Vietnam, fish farming of pangas catfish is developing too since a few years for both domestic and international markets. Fish farming of ""pangas"" is a traditional activity in Vietnam. In order to allow fish farmers not to depend on wild fry in stocking their ponds and cages, a collaborative scientific programme between France and Vietnam was set up in 1995 aimed at mastering artificial propagation of the two main cultured species, (cultured in cages) and (cultured in manured ponds). Successfully achieved in 1995, the artificial propagation of pangas led to deep changes in the panga chain. , grown in cages and the main species for export, displayed difficult sexual maturation in captivity and relatively low fecundity. The other species, , showed easy maturation in captivity and a 10 times higher fecundity. Under these conditions, has become the main culture species. At the same time, the trend evolved towards an increasing use of industrial feed due to the increasing price of trash fish used for on-farm feed manufacturing. Production costs come to 0.6-0.7 US$/kg (0,4-0,47 euro/kg). In Indonesia, fish farming of pangas really started in the nineties. It is based upon one exotic introduced species, , and an indigenous one, , cultured both in ponds and in cages, in lakes and in rivers, within mostly small scale family farms on Java, Sumatra and Borneo Islands. Vietnam's panga production is estimated at 800,000 mt for 2006 and 1 M mt for 2007, mainly exported. In Indonesia, production for 2006 is estimated at 31,000 mt. ### Countries mentioned: Viet Nam;France;Indonesia ### Animal products search: fish ### Programs found: scientific program;collaborative scientific program ### Topics keywords: small scale;agro food;value chain;international market ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2009,,Cahiers Agricultures,,,,,,,#36884,,"",""

History of Technology and Humanitarian Technologies A case study regarding the design and deployment of humanitarian technologies among rural communities in Colombia,"","Abstract: This paper reports a project that integrated grass-root communities of Alto Magdalena and Tequendama, Cundinamarca and academics from Uniminuto (Colombia) and Algoma (Canada) Universities. This partnership led to the participative design of a technological training program about regional development. This program combines three elements: world views, ancestral knowledge and the needs that the farming and peasant communities of Cundinamarca perceive as imperative. The authors were invited to join the initiative by leading a historical reflection on the conflicting views of technology as a source of community and environmental difficulties, and also as an opportunity to overcome the pressing challenges that rural communities face nowadays (i.e. young people migration, low productivity and environmental degradation). This dialogue between academics and community members dealt with technological initiatives, such as energy for lighting and cooking, grass-root initiatives for rural connectivity and social media, water & sanitation, and agricultural technologies. In addition, a debate took place that focus on the community memory about large scale institutional programs for technological development. The paper discusses the motivation, methodology, outcomes, and conclusions of this partnership. The discussion has a socio-technical perspective, linking concrete technological initiatives to a broader understanding of the economical, political, cultural and environmental factors that define successful humanitarian technology implementation. ### Countries mentioned: Colombia;Canada ### Programs found: participative design technological training program;technological development program;paper report project;institutional program;development program;technological initiative;training program;concrete technological initiative ### Topics keywords: rural community;young people;rural area;large scale ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",2016,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE SIXTH IEEE GLOBAL HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE GHTC 2016,,,,,,,#36917,,"",""
Improving government farm programs for limited-resource farmers.,"","Abstract: Participation in US public conservation programmes is voluntary, but violation of the Food Security Act's conservation provisions results in the ineligibility of participants for other USDA commodity programmes. The absence of adequate, relevant and timely information for limited-resource farmers (LRF) hinders their participation and compliance with the new conservation provisions. LRF operate less than 50 acres, have an annual gross household income of less than $25 000 and have a generally low educational level. The paper summarizes results of a study conducted in southern USA to investigate LFR characteristics, programme participation and knowledge, and views on information sources and preferred delivery systems. Development of the necessary information and the means of disseminating this should be based on the profile of the farm operators, farm characteristics and level of knowledge of the target group about other government farm programmes.

Improving tall fescue shade tolerance: identifying candidate genotypes.,"","Abstract: Tall fescue is genetically variable for many agronomic traits, so it might be possible to increase its persistence and productivity in shaded agroforestry applications. The objective of this research was to identify high yielding, shade-tolerant genotypes. Seed was obtained from eight families: seven plant introductions of European origin: 234718, 234720, 234882, 234884, 235018, 235019, 235036, and one cultivar (Kentucky 31). Two sequential experiments were conducted to select genotypes for dry mass yield during April to September. Experiment (Exp) 1 included 30 genotypes of each of the eight families randomly assigned to each of two microenvironments: artificially shaded with fabric and unshaded. Maximum and minimum yields were 93.9 and 47.1 g family for Kentucky 31 and 235036, respectively. After 1 yr, the proportion of vigorous survivors in Exp 1 was greater in the unshaded than shaded environment (0.40 and 0.09, respectively), and ranged from 0 to 0.56 (235036 and Kentucky 31, respectively). Forty robust genotypes (one later died) from four families (234718, 234720, 235019, and Kentucky 31) were selected from shaded and unshaded microenvironments of Exp 1, clonally propagated, and evaluated in pots for 2 yr in Exp 2. Shade-selected Kentucky 31 yielded more (31.0 g plant) in shade than other shade-selected families (25.2 to 25.8 g plant). Eleven genotypes in the top quartile (yield ≥33.0 g plant) were selected for further testing. All genotypes were endophyte -infected. Future research will include seed increases and measuring yield in shaded, water-deficit conditions of a tree understory. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Topics keywords: experiment conducted;plant height;drought stress;DM;growing season;significant difference;drip irrigation;soil moisture;use efficiency;water deficit;dry matter;flow rate ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,"Agroforestry comes of age: putting science into practice.

"Irrigation strategies for rotational grazing pasture in Canterbury, New Zealand, and impacts on irrigation efficiency.","","Abstract: To support irrigation efficiency improvement, it is essential to identify the major limitations to irrigation management. Thirty-two dairy farmers in Canterbury, New Zealand, were interviewed in order to understand current irrigation strategies on pastoral farms, particularly in relation to grazing rotations and plant available water (PAW). A water balance model, IrriCalc, was used to estimate irrigation and drainage from irrigation strategies obtained from the survey. Current irrigation strategies differ greatly from farm to farm, which depend solely on PAW with no consideration for grazing rotations. During shoulder seasons (Sept-Oct and Mar-Apr) the majority of farmers start irrigation at 50% PAW and stop at 80% PAW. During the peak irrigation season (Nov-Feb) irrigation mostly starts at 70% PAW and stops at 100% PAW, leaving no room for precipitation. Results showed that over 14 irrigation seasons (2001/2002-2014/2015) this irrigation strategy would have produced a range of drainage per irrigation season between 40 and 400 mm, which demonstrates a high potential of optimising current irrigation strategies. Better utilization of rainfall during the irrigation season would minimize irrigation requirements and drainage losses. This would help to address the issues of nutrient losses and relieve the pressure on water resources. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand;United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: winter wheat;bulk density;land cover ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2018,,Irrigation and Drainage,,,,,,,#37403,,"",""
Mass wasting and sediment storage in a small montane watershed: An extreme case of anthropogenic disturbance in the humid tropics,"","Abstract: By the peak of land-use conversion for subsistence cropping and plantation agriculture in Puerto Rico in the 1940's, 94 percent of the original forest cover had been eliminated. In a small (26.4 km(2)) upland watershed that typifies this land-use history, field surveys and examination of aerial photographs indicate that more than 2,000 landslides have occurred since about 1820 when forest clearing began. The landslides are attributable to a combination of three factors: a highly weathered bedrock (Cretaceous granodiorite), episodic heavy rainfall, and almost two centuries of intense land-use practices. On average, landslide scars number 140/km(2) in the Cayaguds watershed, equal to 80 landslide scars/km(2)/100 y. The volume of hillslope material eroded by landsliding is estimated at 660,000 m(3)/km(2) (870,000 Mg/km(2)). If all colluvium was transported from the catchment, then the volume is equivalent to a mean surface lowering of the entire watershed by 660 mm, or 3.8 mm/y. Soil augering, field observations at construction sites, road cuts and stream banks, mapping from aerial photographs, and GIS-based estimates of the surface area of footslopes, indicate that colluvium may total 149,000 Mg/km2. If mobilized, this would be sufficient stored material to supply the annual average fluvial sediment yield for as long as 129 years. The great availability of colluvial and alluvial sediment on footslopes, floodplains, and in channels will maintain high sediment yield well into the 21st century in spite of government efforts to reforest hillslopes and institute other hillslope soil conservation measures. ### Countries mentioned: Puerto Rico ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;land use change;land cover;geographic information system;land use;forest cover;protected area;GIS ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2001,,GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES AND RIVERINE HABITAT,,,,,,,#36957,,"",interventions; livestock
Multi-agent simulations to explore rules for rural credit in a highland farming community of Northern Thailand,"","Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) open new modelling and analysis perspectives in ecological and social sciences. An original characteristic of the companion modelling (ComMod) approach adopted in this case study is the co-construction and use of a MAS model with and for local stakeholders such as farmers and local administrators. Alternating iteratively field and modelling activities, this approach facilitates collective learning among local stakeholders and between them and the researchers. Combining the use of MAS models with role-playing games (RPG), the described experiment aimed to facilitate collective decision-making in a socially heterogeneous community of small farmers in mountainous Northern Thailand about the local rules for the allocation of rural credit to allow a more equitable and extensive process of expansion of non-erosive perennial crops in a watershed prone to erosion. This paper presents the MAS model and the results of a series of simulations exploring the ecological, social and economic effects of various rules for formal and informal credit suggested by the villagers-participants. Six scenarios considered as pertinent to further explore the participants' suggestions were defined based on different combinations among the following three variables: (i) Duration for the reimbursement of loans, (ii) Mode of allocation of formal credit among three different types of farms, (iii) Configuration of networks of acquaintances for access to informal credit. Drawing on this case study, we first elaborate on the potential of bottom-up models such as MAS to analyze the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and rural credit dynamics. We highlight the ability of MAS to deal with interactions between social and ecological dynamics and to provide an alternative to classical economic thinking by analyzing the effects at the village level of social interactions among individuals. MAS allow us in particular to trigger an overlooked but nevertheless fundamental aspect of socio-ecological systems, i.e. social capital which is a determining factor when dealing with sustainability issues. The second question addressed in this paper deals with the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up (or participatory) modelling approach. This experiment suggests that the usefulness of models relies much more on the modelling process than on the model itself, because a model is usually useless if it is misunderstood by its potential users, or if it does not respond to their current preoccupations. The intuitive representation of real systems provided by MAS and their high flexibility are the two underlined characteristics favouring their appropriation by local stakeholders. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Topics keywords: social capital;decision making;drought stress ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2008,,Ecological Economics,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.10.022,,#36825,,"",interventions; livestock

Managing semi-arid woodlands for carbon storage: grazing and shrub effects on above- and belowground carbon.,"","Abstract: Shrub cover has increased in semi-arid regions worldwide. This change has generally been viewed as land degradation, due to shrub-induced declines in pastoral productivity. As a consequence, widespread management treatments to reduce shrub density have been applied in many pastoral areas. These treatments, however, often do not have long-term positive benefits for forage production.

Mitigating land pollution through pesticide packages Ð The case of a collection scheme in Rural China,"","Abstract: Pesticide packages that are discarded on agricultural land can contaminate water bodies and pose a threat to the environment and human health. Little is known about how developing countries deal with this kind of land pollution. While in developed countries, packages are collected by professional organizations, the smallholder context in developing countries makes the collection of this waste much more difficult. This paper introduces and analyses a successful Pesticide Package Collection Scheme in one of the poorest regions in China, i.e. Guangxi Province. The purpose of the paper is to analyze and discuss how such a scheme can be established by multiple actors. The paper finds that the underlying success factors for establishing such a scheme are 1.) that a scheme piggy-bags on existing economic structures that reach out to farmers (e.g. associations); 2.) that the scheme itself facilitates actors' exchange of resources to establish a temporary resource equilibrium; 3.) that all stakeholders obtain returns on their investment, even if the quality and time scale of these returns may differ. The initiation of the scheme by a pesticide company however increased both its political and market influence. Caution hence has to be paid to whether the short-term improvement in land pollution happens at the expense of a dependency on and increased use of certain kinds of pesticides. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;short term;developed country;water body;developing country;land cover;human health;risk assessment;BMP;human activity ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2018,,Science of the Total Environment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.11.330,,#37186,,"",interventions; livestock
An updated economic evaluation of waterponding.,"","Abstract: Many areas in the pastoral lands of western New South Wales contain patches of scalded soils, resulting in a dramatic decrease in productivity. The scalding has been a result of a lack of understanding of the special characteristics and requirements of the area leading to the adoption of unsuitable grazing practices, especially in the early years of settlement. With a lack of new areas available for grazing and a desire to rehabilitate the country to a more productive state, several techniques useful in reclaiming scalds have been investigated. Of these techniques, waterponding has promised to be the most practical and efficient method of returning scalded country to a high level of production. The technique involves constructing banks to reduce runoff and increase infiltration into the soil. An earlier evaluation of waterponding, (1987) suggested that the technique was of doubtful financial feasibility. This paper reappraises the situation in the light of improved construction techniques leading to reduced maintenance costs. The results are relevant to a representative property in the Marra Creek area, north of Nyngan, but are a useful guide for evaluating the feasibility of waterponding in other areas. The results indicate that the technique is feasible given a range of costs and wool returns. ### Countries mentioned: United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: beef cattle;decision making;net return ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1990,,Australian Journal of Soil and Water Conservation,,,,,,,#36593,,"",""
Bovine mastitis: human and management factors. Associations with milk yield and milk quality.,"","Abstract: The study was conducted in 123 randomly selected dairy farms from the East of Ireland. Sociodemographic and human and management variables were collected by a single interviewer using a structured questionnaire. Human variables included the farmer's sociodemographic characteristics, his attitudes, goals and values. Management variables covered the farm installations and policies being applied, including hygiene practices and mastitis control measures. After multiple stepwise regression human variables appeared in all regression models. Low cell counts were associated with geographical location, the use of dry cow therapy, breeding its own replacements, a positive attitude towards milking, and working in family. High cell counts were associated with small herds, irregular testing of the milking machine, lack of bedding on top of concrete, washing the dirty cows only, and low risk-willingness. Low total bacterial counts were associated with the use of dry cow therapy, and high counts with 'tied up' housing, old milking machines, bucket plants, shorter withdrawal periods after antibiotic treatment, and low score information seeking behaviour. High milk yields were linked with bigger herds, the use of dry cow therapy, average information seeking behaviour, high awareness, and culling. Meanwhile, low yields were associated with bucket plants and barn pipelines, lack of hot water where the cows are milked, the use of a single wet cloth to wash the udder, low attendance at farming related meetings, high score in continuing the family farming tradition, and no holidays. High fat yields were associated with treating cows at drying off, the use of credit, average independence, and high awareness of subclinical mastitis. Two noticeable exclusions from the models were teat dipping and farmer's age. None of these variables were significantly associated with farm performance even in the bi-variate analysis. Scattered diagrams of age against the dependent variables showed a random distribution. ### Countries mentioned: Ireland ### Animal products search: cow milk ### Topics keywords: dependent variable;milking machine;dairy farm;factor affecting;family farming;attitude towards ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1988,,Acta Veterinaria Scandinavica,,,,,,,#36304,,"",""
"Estrogens: Properties, behaviors, and fate in dairy manure-amended soils","","Abstract: In 2012 there were 63% fewer dairies in the United States than there were in 1997 as a result of conglomeration of the dairy industry into concentrated animal feeding operations at the expense of smaller farms. Today, 60% of all milk produced in the United States comes from 5% of the nation's dairies (operations with >= 500 cows). Concentrated animal feeding operations are touted as economically efficient agricultural business models, hailed for their increased milk yields. Yet, with an average daily manure production of over 27 000 kg for a 500-head dairy farm, manure storage and disposal are serious management and environmental concerns. A common economical mode of manure disposal is application to nearby agricultural fields. However, a major concern with land application of dairy manure is the fate of manure-borne hormones, compounds considered chemicals of emerging concern, and the potential threat these hormones pose to humans and the environment. The fate of these chemicals in the soil environment is complicated by multiple edaphic variables including pH, mineralogy, organic matter, microbial activity, and redox status. Estrogens are sorbed by soil organic matter and transformed to nonbioactive, highly soluble conjugated forms or to metabolites that exhibit yet additional properties distinct from their parent compounds. However, deconjugation frequently occurs, regenerating endocrine-disrupting free estrogen compounds. It is challenging to fully understand the behavior and predict the fate of estrogenic compounds from dairy manure in soils because of variable and complex interactions with soil factors, as well as possible interactions among the different chemicals of emerging concern. This review focuses on the behavior of naturally occurring estrogen hormones present in dairy manure in the soil environment. Heightened understanding of the fate of these compounds in soil will enhance our ability to reduce their potential risks. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: manure production;manure ### Topics keywords: DM;OM;microbial community;dairy industry;dairy farm;microbial activity;organic matter;SOM ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2017-0005,,#36324,,"",""
Financing Agricultural Development in Serbia: Opportunities and Challenges,"","Abstract: This paper overviews the opportunities and risks of Serbian agriculture's development with the special accent on its financing. We take into account its impact from macroeconomic, social, and individual business perspective, and lay it in context European Union (EU) agricultural policy and changes in Serbian trade policy in line with Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) implementation. After discussing the current situation and key characteristics of Serbia's agriculture, we narrow down the research, through identification of dual nature of Serbian farming by locating trends in large-scale agriculture and giving a picture of small-scale agricultural sector using LSMS survey database provided by World Bank. After describing main risks of agricultural business and policy objectives and instruments, the main novelty is a detailed case study of a corn producing farm in Serbian lowland with different financing scenarios. We illustrate previous insights on challenges, risks and policies into a coherent system, by using data along the period from 2008 to 2013. The main conclusions include that major improvement in net cash inflows stem from improvements in cultivation technologies of mercantile corn, relatively significant improvements in average net cash flow are reachable with insurance from drought. Irrigation technology may reduce yield volatility, but initial investments are financially unsustainable with regular commercial loans. That is why we suggest shifting to higher value crops, such as seed corn, which should be considered in case of installation of irrigation systems. In such case, even commercial loans may become a suitable way of financing of investment. The main overall message from the analysis calls for holistic approach in formulating policies aiming to enable sustainable rural development, competitiveness and appropriate financing of output growth amidst rapid global changes and European integrations. ### Countries mentioned: Serbia ### Plant products search: maize;wheat ### Topics keywords: take account;water saving;agricultural machinery;EU;point view;taking account;taken account;large scale;beef cattle;raw material;small scale;current situation;arable land;rural development;economic benefit;rural area;animal husbandry;sustainable development;dairy industry ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2014,,Ekonomika preduzeca,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1608625&site=ehost-live,,#37373,,"",""
Herbage yield and animal production from grassland on three commercial dairy farms in South‐East England,"","Abstract: Yields of grass were measured on three dairy farms in 1981. Farm 1, on free‐draining loamy soil over chalk, produced 10.3 t DM ha−1 using 336 kg N ha−1. Farm 2, on poorly‐drained loam over Oxford clay, produced 12.8 t DM ha−1 using 354 kg N ha−1. Farm 3, on loam over clay with some free‐draining sandy loam, produced 9.5 t DM ha−1 with 169 kg N ha−1. Allowing for differences in soil nitrogen and summer rainfall these yields were quite close to expectations from experimental results, despite considerable poaching damage to some swards. Animal production records were kept and all livestock were weighed every 6 months, so as to calculate the utilized metabolizable energy (UME) output from grassland on each farm. These were 73, 62 and 59 GJ ha−1 on farms 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The UME output, expressed as a proportion of the yield of grass (converted to ME), was taken as the ‘efficiency of utilization’ of grass. This was 70% on farm 1,44% on farm 2 and 58% on farm 3. Results are presented separately for the summer and winter 6 months. Utilization by grazing appeared to be markedly reduced under very wet soil conditions. Major losses occurred in the conservation of grass. The results begin to establish a valuable base of data from commercial farms. ### Countries mentioned: United States;United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: DM;decision maker;NH4;dairy farm;dry matter;decision making;NO3 ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1984,,Grass and Forage Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.1984.tb01679.x,,#36782,,"",""
Improving the efficiency of aquaculture extension activity in the southeastern provinces of Southern Vietnam.,"","Abstract: The Faculty of Fisheries of the University of Agriculture and Forestry (FoF-UAF) in collaboration with the Aqua Outreach programme of the Asian Institute of Technology has implemented since 1994 farmer-managed on-farm trials in two different agroecological (rainfed and irrigated) areas of four provinces (Tay Ninh, Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc and Long An) to develop fish culture in ponds of small-scale households in the southeast region of southern Vietnam. Baseline surveys carried out prior to the trials have pointed out problems of fish culture of farmers in the two selected areas, e.g. pond preparation, cultured fish selection, stocking density, and water quality management. After 3 years implementation of the on-farm trials, appropriate recommendations of low-cost fish culture for small-scale farmers in the two agroecological areas have been produced. The average fish yield of 56 project farms in three provinces (Tay Ninh, Binh Phuoc and Long An), has increased around 40, 25 and 70%, respectively. Since 1996 the project staff have collaborated with Agricultural Extension Centres (AECs) of the three provinces to train about 700 farmers on fish culture based on the proven recommendations. Moreover, three sets of leaflets on fish culture in ponds for different agroecological areas based on appropriate techniques have also been designed to support extension activities of the provincial AECs. To improve the efficiency of the AECs on aquacultural technique transfer, the FoF-UAF has organized several short training courses to upgrade knowledge and skills for AEC staff. In 1996, 64 extension staff of the three provinces were trained on integrated fish culture and extension methods and 41 extension workers have been trained on methods of fish culture on-farm trials and extension material production to date. The fish culture on-farm trials have been shown to be an efficient method to produce appropriate recommendations for small-scale farmers. However, some difficulties in implementation of the trials need to be overcome for further expansion. ### Countries mentioned: Viet Nam ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Animal products search: fish ### Programs found: project farmer (PF);aqua outreach program;collaboration aqua outreach program;outreach program ### Measurements for crops: fish ### Topics keywords: small scale;animal welfare;extension worker;extension service;small scale farmer;stocking density;ICT ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2002,,Rural aquaculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1079/9780851995656.0285,,#36352,,"",""
Crop health capacity-building in least developed countries: a unique approach.,"","Abstract: Agriculture employs over 70% of the workforce in Laos, one of the least developed countries in the world, and provides approximately 27% of total GDP. Intensifying vegetable production will increase plant pest and disease pressure and significant on-farm losses for the majority of subsistence and smallholder cooperative farmers. Intensification is likely to happen if Laos is to meet the World Trade Organization Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the 'SPS Agreement') requirements for exports to the ASEAN economic community and international markets. This will be a major challenge in the horticultural production areas of Savannakhet and the Bolaven Plateau because there is little capacity in crop health there to support farmers. In collaboration with Provincial Government authorities and the Australian Government volunteer program (AVID) managed by Scope Global, the Crawford Fund has committed to a long-term program to build capacity in crop health, biosecurity and food safety in Laos since 2009. Engaging volunteer early-career scientists to deliver insect and disease diagnostics training has increased the capacity of local counterparts to provide crop protection advice. Placements provide context-specific training and longer-term sustainability through gradual training, while also giving volunteers an opportunity to engage in a career in international agricultural development. Crawford e-mentors support volunteers in five countries with advice and pro-bono laboratory services - a unique feature of the program. Crop management strategies have already been implemented on key farms with the help of local staff, leading to reduced crop loss and increased yields. This long-term commitment will contribute to rural economic development of the smallholder farm sector in Laos, and facilitate trade in rural commodities. ### Countries mentioned: Lao People's Democratic Republic;Australia ### Plant products search: vegetables ### Programs found: term program;australian government volunteer program;pro bono laboratory service unique feature program;long term (LT) program ### Measurements for interventions: workforce ### Topics keywords: developed country;short term;value chain;agro food;developing country;longer term;GDP;food safety;EU;factor influencing;international market;world trade;gross domestic product;long term;WTO ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,"Proceedings of the Crawford Fund 2016 Annual Conference: waste not, want not: the circular economy to food security, Canberra, ACT, Australia, 29-30 August 2016",,,,,,,#36184,,"",""
Farm level analysis of risk and risk management strategies and policies: cross country analysis.,"","Abstract: An assessment of the producer's exposure to risk is the first step towards building the policy framework in risk management. However, if there are risks that are somehow covered by government programs, the incentives to use other strategies ( insurance or diversification) are reduced. A good understanding of the net impact of government policies related to risk management in agriculture is necessary to improve the effectiveness of policy. This paper addresses these issues from a microeconomic perspective. It uses valuable and unique time series (historical) data from individual farms in seven countries (Australia, Estonia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and UK) to assess the risk environment faced by individual farmers. This empirical information is used to calibrate a microeconomic model to simulate farmers' responses to different risk environments and policy changes in the UK and Australia. This stochastic simulation allows for estimates to be made of the policy impacts on the distribution of farm income, farm welfare and farming risk management behaviour. The assessment of the risk environment at the farm level shows that the individual risk environment can significantly differ from sectoral or aggregate risk, and that farmers can benefit from some correlations to manage their risk. The yield risk at the farm level tends to be greater than at the aggregated level and is comparable with price risk. In many cases, farmers benefit from the negative price-yield correlation and imperfect correlation of yields and prices of different crops through output diversification. The variability of farm income depends on the variability of prices, yields, costs and support, but it also depends on the co-variability among all these elements and the diversification in production. The decomposition of income risk indicates the significant contribution of output diversification and price-yield correlation to stabilize income. According to the sample data, in the absence of correlations and diversification, the variance of income would be as high as twice the observed variance. The microeconomic model simulations indicate the importance of the interaction between a government program and the producer's risk management strategy. All policies are likely to reduce the use of other risk management instruments, particularly diversification. Highly decoupled payments, such as the Single Farm Payment in the European Union, have very limited crowding-out effects on other risk management strategies and a very limited effect in reducing income variability. Insurance subsidies and minimum price intervention are, in general, more effective in reducing income variability, but crowding-out effects may offset initial reductions in income variability if the level of the subsidy is too large. Direct payments triggered by systemic risk indicators or by low income tests - such as the Exceptional Circumstances programs in Australia - are better targeted to low income for each farm and across farms. However, systemic risks, such as droughts, are not always correlated with the lowest income for an individual and it has been found that a payment based purely on an income test can be more effective in reducing income variability and improving farmers' welfare. Overall, both descriptive and simulation analysis implies that policies need to empower farmers to take their own risk management decisions and to have access to a diversity of instruments and strategies, recognizing that the farmer has much better information on the nature of his own risk environment than do researchers or governments. ### Countries mentioned: Germany;United Kingdom;Estonia;Netherlands;Australia;Italy;New Zealand ### Programs found: impact government program;government program;exceptional circumstance program ### Topics keywords: paddy field;short term;CAP;time series;direct payment;NDVI;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2010,,"OECD Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Working Papers",,,,,,,#36779,,"",""
Local institution-building and resource management in the West African Sahel.,"","Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the World Bank and other donors have provided support to the formation of pastoral organizations (POs) to serve as community-based instruments of natural resource management (NRM) and development. POs now organize various natural resource management actions and provide development services to local communities. Water points provide a basis for small cohesive groups and their management can become the first main activity in an improved NRM regime. Although POs have low income-generation capacities and financial viability, many are able to run certain economic activities, such as veterinary drug stores with some profit and they may be encouraged to raise charges for water and herding services from absentee herd owners. This paper points to the need for greater governmental commitment in terms of resource allocations, support for tenurial reforms and secure access to water and grazing resources and higher efficiency in the provision of development services and infrastructure. It recommends a shift from a project approach to a broader institutional development approach. More systematic efforts are required to build competence and capacity in government and donor agencies in local institution-building and NRM. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;local community;natural resource management;land degradation;rural community;rural tourism;protected area;large scale;social capital",1992,,Paper - Pastoral Development Network,,,,,,,#36788,,"",""
Man and the biology of arid zones.,"","Abstract: The central theme of this book is the destruction of habitable and productive environments by man and the problems of restoring these arid zones to productivity in the future. The author suggests that, primarily through interference with the soil and vegetation, desiccation of the landscape is induced by man, and that the change from settled agriculture to nomadic pastoralism leads to further degradation of the environment to desert. Concentration of livestock (especially the domestic goat) and overgrazing are recognized as contributing to the development of more arid landscapes and finally to the expansion of deserts. Increasing sterility in one area, or the proximity of disease in neighbouring, more humid, environments, leads to even greater human concentration in the populated arid zone. . ### Topics keywords: ecosystem service;rural tourism;GIS",1977,,Man and the biology of arid zones.,,,,,,,#36365,,"",""
Characterization for index based livestock insurance.,"","Abstract: Pastoral populations of sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to losses in wealth and productive assets via herd mortality shocks. Although conventional insurance mechanisms covering individual losses are not cost effective in low-income extensive grazing pastoral communities, index insurance for livestock offers a promising alternative. This paper identifies regions most suitable for an index-based livestock insurance product: areas predicted to have high covariate risk from drought, high potential demand for a livestock insurance product, and supporting market infrastructure for an insurance product. Our findings support current efforts to implement index insurance in Kenya and Ethiopia, and reveal additional areas for geographic expansion in western and southern Africa. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: SSA;crop insurance;BMP;cost effective;economic benefit;pest control;smallholder farmer;index insurance ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2016,,Characterization for index based livestock insurance,,,,,,,#37599,,"",""
"Pastoral commons sense: lessons from recent developments in policy, law and practice for the management of grazing lands.","","Abstract: The paper analyses key issues concerning the collective management of grazing lands, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. In the dry belt South of the Sahara, natural resource management systems need to come to terms with an environment characterised by scarce and erratic rainfall, entailing that resources fluctuate considerably in time and space, and that neither the resource base nor the user community are stable and clearly delimited. Herd mobility is the key strategy used by herders to cope with this difficult environment. As with other common pool resources (CPR), recent legislation has moved towards the recognition of mobility as the key strategy for pastoral resource management, although implementation is lagging and bedevilled by conflict and ambiguity among the plethora of institutions involved. Examples of successful and less successful CPR pastoral systems - ranging from the Scottish crofters to Kenyan Masai - are given. The paper describes the importance of common rangelands for the livelihoods of the poor and the major trends in relevant policy and legislation, analyses a series of successful and unsuccessful rangeland management systems, and draws conclusions on the factors affecting the nature and performance of these systems. It discusses key factors affecting the nature and performance of CPR management regimes and the importance of establishing secure legal rights for local communities over the grazing land on which they depend, and creating conditions that enable local communities and their elected representatives to assume their responsibilities and manage these resources in a sustainable and equitable manner. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: natural resource;local community;natural resource management;land degradation;SSA;rural community;rural tourism;protected area;large scale;smallholder farmer;social capital;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2004,,"Forests, Trees and Livelihoods",,,,,,,#36935,,"",""
Farmer perspectives of the on-farm and off-farm pros and cons of planted multifunctional riparian margins.,"","Abstract: The planting of riparian margins is a policy option for pastoral farmers in response to land use induced environmental issues such as declining water quality, stream bank erosion, and loss of aquatic and terrestrial habitat. We elicited the views and experiences as to pros and cons of planting riparian margins from two sets of dairy farmers from Taranaki, New Zealand: those who are or have planted riparian margins, and those who have not yet done so. Those farmers who have planted riparian margins identified 21 positive aspects of riparian margin plantings and 11 negative aspects of riparian margin plantings. Perceived benefits identified by this group include water quality, increased biodiversity, the provision of cultural ecosystem services, immediate direct benefits to farm management and the farm system, and in some instances increased productivity on-farm. In contrast, those farmers that had fenced but not planted their riparian margins did not consider that riparian margin plantings could add further benefits to that which could be achieved by excluding stock from waterways, and associated only negative perceptions with riparian margin plantings. Planting riparian margins is not cost neutral and will not deliver anticipated environmental benefits in every situation. However, we argue that riparian margin plantings are an important ecological infrastructure investment that needs to be captured within a wider policy framework, the benefits of which extend beyond the mitigation of a single negative externality generated by land use practices, such as nutrient loss, and contribute to a multifunctional landscape. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Topics keywords: natural resource;land use;ecosystem service ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Land Use Policy,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.10.053,,#36959,,"",""
Oil palm genetic improvement and sustainable development,"","Abstract: Genetic improvement of the oil palm may have a role to play in the sustainability of this crop. Given the criticism aimed at this commodity chain, notably due to the extension of oil palm plantations to the detriment of forests, providing very high-yielding planting material might be a solution, particularly as world demand is continually increasing. This crop is mostly managed by agroindustrialists, but the smallholder sector is developing. It happens that this sector is classed as a sustainable type of agriculture by numerous NGOs, which are also asking plant breeders to take the specificities of smallholdings into consideration. Oil palm genetic improvement takes numerous criteria into account, many of which fit in with sustainable agriculture. For example, this crop is subject to pressure from different pests and diseases. In each case, a genetic hence eco-friendly approach has been taken and, in particular, vascular wilt-tolerant planting material has been a successfully produced. Moreover, for the future of this crop, planting material needs to be developed that requires fewer inputs, and consideration has to be given to extending this crop in less favourable zones, by developing planting material that consumes less water. Lastly, it is important to disseminate genetically diversified planting material. ### Topics keywords: genetic improvement;sustainable development;drought stress;eco friendly;rural community;oil palm;planting material;elaeis guineensis;SA;NGO;dairy cattle;sweet potato;contract farming;sustainable agriculture;oil palm plantation",2005,,OCL - Oleagineux Corps Gras Lipides,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1051/ocl.2005.0141,,#36969,,"",""
Monsoon failure and drought situation in 2012: a case study of Vijayapura district.,"","Abstract: Drought is a situation in which there is a prolonged deficiency of rainfall over a wide area resulting in serious depletion of soil moisture and consequent poor agricultural production and general water shortage, resulting in low incomes and great public suffering and distress. There are three types of drought namely; Meteorological drought, Hydrological drought, and Agricultural drought (Anon, 2014). Agriculture is the first sector to be affected by drought. Data pertaining to the extent of rainfall deviation in the Vijayapura district, crop loss, drought affected area, relief and rehabilitations measures were analysed using tabular presentation and trend analysis. In Vijayapura district, highest rainfall was observed in the year 2009 and lowest in the year 1998. Rainfall followed a positive trend (1.95%) during the study period. The district faced, moderate drought in the 2012. Among the five taluks of the district, Vijayapura taluka was worst affected with 50 per cent deficient of rainfall. In the district out of 4.68 lakh ha targeted area for cultivation in 2012 , only 58 per cent area was sown. Of this 58 per cent sown area 97 per cent area was affected with severe drought.

Multiple stress response and belowground competition in multilines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.),"","Abstract: Multilines (genetic mixtures) composed of genotypes of contrasting root architecture were hypothesized to show improved growth and productivity in comparison with genetic monocultures in conditions of multiple edaphic stresses. To test this hypothesis, three multilines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), each composed of two recombinant inbred lines having contrasting root architecture in previous studies, were evaluated at seven sites in Honduras with varying soil phosphorus and moisture availability. Molecular markers were used to quantify the presence of each genotype in both root and seed-yield samples. Root growth in competition was dependent on both soil treatment and genotype. In one of the multilines, the root zone was dominated by one genotype, especially in the high-P treatment. In contrast, the root zone of another multiline had equal representation from both genotypes. These results show that response to belowground competition can differ among genotypes of the same species. No tradeoff between root growth and plant performance (yield or shoot biomass) was observed. Contrary to expected results, profiles of root distribution did not differ significantly in the environments tested in this study. As a result, differences in uptake of resources (phosphorus and water) in divergent soil domains and yield advantage of multilines were observed in only a small number of cases. Multilines did not create any yield penalty. Future work with genotypes that are more contrasting in root architecture is necessary to assess this strategy for use by resource-poor farmers. ### Countries mentioned: Honduras ### Plant products search: phaseolus;common beans;grain legumes ### Topics keywords: root zone;soil moisture;drip irrigation;drought stress ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2010,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2010.03.004,,#36371,,"",""

Biological control has previously shown promise to supplement cultural control methods practiced by the majority of smallholders. Mixed inocula were most effective against multiple pathogens in Peru, but not in Costa Rica, where spp. seemed to antagonize spp. The objective of our study was to systematically investigate the mycoparasitic interactions between and species, in order to enable the design of mixed inocula in a rational manner. Specifically, we aimed to quantify dominance of one mycoparasite genus over the other using tests as well as field experiments. The compatibility of Peruvian and Costa Rican isolates of known efficacy was tested by pair-wise confrontations on water agar as well as two host-range assays, one of which mycoparasites were offered another mycoparasite as only host and one where conidia of a and a isolate were mixed at ratios ranging from 1:100 to 100:1 in order to determine dominance on the susceptible host, . A field study quantified survival and establishment of selected mixtures on surface-sterilized cocoa pods. Hyphal interactions and host-range studies coincided in identifying as the most aggressive mycoparasite, closely followed by . spp. were least aggressive; instead, they were highly susceptible to spp. The outcome of interactions depended on the species used and occasionally even on the isolates confronting each other. The country of origin, however, was irrelevant. Parasitic growth of was unaffected by , even at an inoculum ratio of 1:100. Parasitic growth of spp. progressively slowed as concentrations rose, but the effect varied in strength with different isolates. When and sp. were applied to cocoa pods in the field either separately or in combination at a ratio of 5:1, dominated at the expense of sp., which was suppressed. At equal or ten times higher concentrations of , was temporarily suppressed, but from two weeks after application, remained the dominant and persistent pod colonizer. Native spp. were poor pioneer colonizers of surface-sterilized pods and applied populations vanished within less than four weeks. Our results suggest that, although spp. antagonize spp., the incompatibility can be partly overcome by adjusting the inoculum ratio of mixed inocula in favor of spp. Therefore, mycoparasitism among several promising biocontrol candidates do not necessarily rule out their combination into a mixed inoculum, but can be addressed by formulating susceptible isolates at higher inoculum ratios. This, however, will not sustainably improve surface coverage by poorly colonizing spp. Therefore, optimal strains for the habitat and task are needed first. ### Countries mentioned: Peru;Costa Rica ### Plant products search: cocoa pods ### Measurements for interventions: pod ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;biocontrol agent;winter wheat;growing season;biological control;field experiment ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2013,,Biological Control,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2013.09.011,,#37443,,"",""
Narrow rows reduce biomass and seed production of weeds and increase maize yield [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Smallholder farmers in southern African countries rely primarily on cultural control and hoe weeding to combat weeds, but often times, they are unable to keep up with the weeding requirements of the crop because of its laboriousness, causing them to incur major yield losses. Optimisation of crop planting pattern could help to increase yield and suppress weeds and to reduce the critical period of weed control and the weeding requirements to attain maximum yield. Experiments were carried out in Zimbabwe during two growing seasons to assess the effect of maize density and spatial arrangement on crop yield, growth and seed production of weeds and to determine the critical period for weeding. Planting maize at 60 cm row distance achieved higher yields and better weed suppression than planting at 75 or 90 cm row distance. Increasing crop densities beyond the customary three to four plants m⁻℗ø gave modest reductions in weed biomass but also diminished crop yields, probably because of increased competition for water and nutrient resources. Maize planted in narrow rows (60 cm) intercepted more radiation and suffered less yield reduction from delaying hoe weeding than those planted in wider rows (75 or 90 cm), and the duration of the weed-free period required to attain maximum grain yield was 3 weeks shorter in the narrow spacing than that in the 75- and 90-cm row spacings. Weeding was more effective in curtailing weed seed production in the narrow row spatial arrangements than in the wide row planting. The results of these studies show that narrow row spacings may reduce weeding requirements and increase yields. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: maize;grain;wheat ### Measurements for crops: maize ### Topics keywords: weed suppression;cover crop;weed free;growing season;weed control;experiment carried;dry matter;smallholder farmer;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2009,,Annals of applied biology an international journal of the AAB,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44259671&site=ehost-live,,#37041,,"",""
National food security policies and challenges: SADCC countries' experiences.,"","Abstract: A summary is presented of some of the food security policies and interventions being pursued by most SADCC member states. Considering the region as a whole, SADCC achieved 98% and 108% self sufficiency in its major staple foods (maize, sorghum and cassava) during the 1988/89 and 1989/90 marketing years respectively. However, the majority of SADCC countries continue to experience food insecurity at both national and household levels. SADCC has failed to exploit the regional self sufficiency position it has attained because of: (1) the likelihood that national authorities are not soon enough aware of the size of national deficit or surplus in order to make advance import and export plans; (2) financial constraints for importing; (3) delays in delivery, quality problems and uncompetitive prices; (4) inadequate transport infrastructure; and (5) lack of a policy on the size of carry-over stock requirements. Factors contributing to low production and inadequate food supply include lack of skilled manpower to implement policies, declining land/man ratios resulting from a high population growth rate, a low level of investment in agriculture, and lack of adequate procurement programmes. The basic factor contributing to household food insecurity is poverty. On the supply side policies such as guaranteed producer prices, resettlement programmes, credit facilities for the small farmer, improved roads, irrigation schemes, tractor hire schemes, food aid and stock establishment, have been introduced. Access to food has been tackled by nutrition programmes and the introduction of minimum wages. Challenges for the 1990s include how to generate foreign and local currency to increase investment in agriculture, how to generate employment, how to combat the effects of drought, and how to improve intra-regional trade. ### Plant products search: sorghum grain;maize;cassava ### Programs found: resettlement program;procurement program;nutrition program ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;CAP;household food insecurity;water saving;household food security;self sufficiency;EU;rural development;member state;irrigation scheme;food security",1990,,"Food security policies in the SADCC region.

"Organization, structures and ranches in Kenya.","","Abstract: This paper was first presented at a February 1980 ILCA Workshop. Livestock management systems in range areas of Kenya can be grouped under two broad headings; pastoral (subsistence-oriented) and commercial (cash economy oriented). Ranch organization structures pre- and post-independence are described, and problems discussed. Any range development policy which requires pastoralists' participation and co-operation should seek approaches in which national interests and people's needs and interests coincide. Kenya's experience indicates a whole range of project types which could be applied to pastoral development. Their success depends on choosing the projects best suited to conditions in a given location at a given time, and on changing them as conditions change. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: rural development;smallholder farmer;land reform ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1981,,"Pastoral Network Paper, Agricultural Administration Unit, Overseas Development Institute",,,,,,,#37117,,"",""
"Participatory development, testing and validation of concepts and technologies for site-specific detection and control of plant parasitic nematodes infecting tomatoes in Mwea, Kenya.","","Abstract: Tomato production in Kenya has been a lucrative business for smallholder farmers who cannot afford huge capital to invest in other cash crops. It is a major source of household incomes and has created employment that has resulted in improved livelihoods. Tomato production is hampered by, among other factors, pests and diseases. Plant parasitic nematodes, particularly root-knot nematodes are a serious pest problem in smallholder tomato farms in Kenya, yet the problem goes unnoticed by majority of farmers as they appear to be unaware of nematodes. Reduction of crop losses due to nematodes is one way of increasing crop yields. This project seeks to; create awareness of the damage caused by nematodes on crops and the economic implications; assess the spatial and temporal distribution of root-knot nematodes in both rain-fed and irrigated tomato fields in Mwea area; define and quantify the significant edaphic factors that regulate the spatial and temporal population dynamics of nematodes in tomato fields and in particular develop, test and validate methods to identify areas in tomato fields that are prone to nematode infestations by correlating the soil factors to the distribution and population densities of root-knot nematodes; create nematode-density-distribution maps for individual fields/soil types which will be superimposed on the physical survey map of the farms; and to validate and develop precision farming technology by carrying out greenhouse and on-farm trials on the nematode distribution map identified to be infested or prone to infestation by nematodes. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: tomatoes ### Topics keywords: site specific;cover crop;spatial distribution;biological control;rural household;population density;protected area;household income;human activity;cash crop;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;precision farming;farming system;management practice;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2010,,"Second RUFORUM Biennial Regional Conference on ""Building capacity for food security in Africa"", Entebbe, Uganda, 20-24 September 2010",,,,,,,#37444,,"",""
Participatory management of coastal resources: a case study of Baganchra-Badurgacha subproject in the South-west of Bangladesh.,"","Abstract: Conflicts in the use of land and water resources for agriculture versus aquaculture constitute a key issue in the coastal zone of Bangladesh. Increasing areas of rice land are converted to aquaculture farms producing shrimp and fin fish which require brackish water. Powerful shrimp producers rent these lands owned mainly by small and medium farmers. The lands are abandoned after a few years when the profitability of these ventures declines. This rapid and unregulated exploitation generates conflict between shrimp producers and landowners, and causes eventual loss in the productivity of valuable land resources. The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) demonstrated the effectiveness of participatory water resource management in addressing this problem and in enhancing sustainable development and management of the land and water resources in the coastal zone in the south-west of Bangladesh. The LGED implemented various subprojects, each covering 1000 ha or less, involving the development of water infrastructure in consultation with stakeholders. Local people are involved in subproject planning, implementation and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M). This generates local enthusiasm for the subproject and facilitates the formation of water management associations (WMAs). Case studies reveal that the local people are key functionaries in the sustainable management of land and water and the WMAs are able to regulate water uses, provide a forum for resolving conflicts and play an important role in making relevant policies at the local level. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh ### Plant products search: rice ### Animal products search: fish ### Programs found: enthusiasm project;sub project (SP) ### Topics keywords: natural resource;local people;play important role;sustainable development;human health;protected area;medicinal plant ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2010,,"Tropical deltas and coastal zones: Food production, communities and environment at the land and water interface",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1079/9781845936181.0335,,#37625,,"",""
Integrating local and scientific knowledge for adaptation to land degradation: Kalahari rangeland management options.,"","Abstract: Despite numerous assessments of the sensitivity and resilience of drylands to degradation, there has been little research into the way affected communities innovate and adapt in response to land degradation. This paper shows how local and scientific knowledge can be combined to identify rangeland management strategies to reduce or adapt to land degradation. To achieve this, we have developed and applied a four-stage social learning approach based on stakeholder participation in three degradation hotspots in communal rangelands of the Kalahari, Botswana. This approach aims to collate, evaluate and apply both scientific and local knowledge on rangeland degradation and management options. First, current practice and possible management options were identified from the literature. Second, a series of semi-structured interviews with rangeland users identified local knowledge of strategies to reduce and adapt to land degradation. Third, these options were discussed and evaluated with rangeland stakeholders in focus groups held across each study region. Finally, the outputs from these focus groups were used to produce rangeland assessment guides for each region that provided management options agreed to be locally relevant by both researchers and local stakeholders. The study found that the majority of strategies reported in the literature were not suitable for use by pastoralists in the Kalahari. However, many of the strategies suggested by stakeholders could only be applied effectively under common property regimes, giving impetus to the growing literature encouraging institutional reform to strengthen common property management regimes. The research stimulated a social learning process that combined knowledge from local stakeholders (both pastoralists and extension workers) with the scientific knowledge of researchers to provide a range of management options that could help land managers reduce or adapt to land degradation. By combining participatory research with insights from scientific literature in this way, more relevant results were provided than either approach could have achieved alone. ### Countries mentioned: Botswana ### Topics keywords: land degradation;LD;extension worker;extension service;semi structured interview;family farming;ICT ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2007,,Land Degradation &amp;Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.777,,#37425,,"",""

"Pastoralists in transition - a case study from Lengijape, Maasai Steppe","","Abstract: The change of the Maasai from pure pastoralists to agropastoralists has brought about serious problems for them. This paper tries to analyse this process of change and to throw some light on the resultant problems. First, it is being shown how the climate of the Maasai Steppe is too dry for a successful cultivation of maize by them, which has become their main food. Successive crop failures and high labour costs have rendered maize-growing a losing-business for the Maasai. Moreover, the State policy of granting certificates of occupancy in the Maasai land to outsiders allowing them to make large-mechanized farms, has alarmed the Maasai so much that many of them rushed back to their home areas to rescue their land from being grapped by other ethnic groups. Thus, they began to abandon their traditional grazing-movements, which are highly adapted to the ecological conditions of the Maasai Steppe. At the same time, the herds of the Maasai were decimated, because of the spread of animal diseases following the deterioration of the State veterinary service system. Added to this are the losses incurred through distress sales of cattle for buying maize for food, at a time at which the maize prices are increasing at a much higher rate than the prices of livestock. This dilemma of the Maasai and their indigenous coping mechanisms are being illustrated by the case of the people of Mokia at Namalulu, with special consideration of the role of women in solving these problems. ### Plant products search: maize ### Topics keywords: animal health;food insecurity;veterinary service;rural household",1995,,GeoJournal,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00812524,,#36837,,"",""
Performance of goats fed on low quality veld hay supplemented with fresh spiny cactus (Opuntia megacantha) mixed with browse legumes hay in Zimbabwe.,"","Abstract: Nutrition is a major constraint in smallholder livestock production; hence, the use of alternative sources which are adaptive to long dry seasons is imperative. The study was conducted to establish options of improving nutrition and palatability and also to determine the performance of goats fed on cactus-browse hay as dry season supplements. Palatability and adequacy of nutrition was investigated using 32 castrated male goat kids. The kids were housed in individual metabolism cages for 84 days in a complete randomised design (CRD) with eight replicates for the four treatment diets. Daily experimental diet, basal diet and water intake were measured, and live mass was measured at weekly intervals. Daily diet intake was significantly different (P<0.05) among treatments. Kids that were supplemented with cactus-Leucaena leucocephala meal (CLLM) consumed more than those on cactus-Acacia angustissima meal (CAAM), cactus-Gliricidia sepium meal (CGSM) and cactus-Pennisetum purpureum meal (CPPM) in that order. CGSM was not readily palatable as goat kids refused to take it when mixed with fresh cactus. Animals that were not supplemented with a source of nitrogen together with those that were supplemented with less palatable diet of CGSM lost weight significantly (P<0.05) initially but gained weight slightly towards the end of the study. Significantly higher weight gains (P<0.05) were observed in animals in CLLM and CAAM treatment. It was concluded that fresh cactus could be used to improve poor quality roughage intakes in goats, and therefore, there is need to promote its use in periods of feed deficit especially in smallholder sector. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: gliricidia;leucaena ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;significant difference;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity;weight gain ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2014,,Tropical Animal Health and Production,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0636-z,,#36382,,"",""

"Performance of Jatropha (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Jatropha curcas</i> L.) under different soil and climatic conditions in Kenya.","","Abstract: As the world's fossil fuel reseverves is shown to be out of oil supply in a few years from now, efforts to finding an alternative, environmentally friendly and sustainable sources of fuel have been heightened towards on-farm biodiesel production and industrial processing of bioethanol. Jatropha ( L.) has been selected among other biodiesel feedstocks targeted for this on-farm biodiesel production with intensive production witnessed in India. In Kenya, however, smallholder farmers are found growing Jatropha despite the limited knowledge about its agro-ecological adaptability. The study hypothesis was that regions for biofuel production have not been properly identified in Kenya. Therefore, the objective of this research was to study the performance of Jatropha under different soil and climatic conditions within the smallholder farms in Kenya. A quantitative baseline survey was conducted from July to August, 2010 in 140 randomly selected farms in Lamu, Kibwezi, Nyando and Bondo districts of Kenya (35 per district). A qualitative in-depth study of 5 farms chosen randomly from each region was also done to verify the information obtained. Results showed that performance of Jatropha was positively linked to humid conditions, well distributed annual rainfall of 500-750 mm, moderately sandy to loam soils, neutral pH and good level of management. It was concluded that good crop management together with climatic and soil suitability are important for successful Jatropha production. Furthermore, it was evident that not all regions where Jatropha is promoted for production in Kenya, though, with suitable climate and soils, support the crop without proper crop management practices. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;India ### Plant products search: jatropha ### Topics keywords: biofuel production;factor affecting;GHG emission;winter wheat;environmental impact;survey conducted;taking account;large scale;long term;raw material;land use change;arable land;climatic condition;energy consumption;CO2;management practice;biogas production;fossil fuel;growing season;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,Asian Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3923/ajar.2013.43.50,,#37005,,"",""
"PERFORMANCE OF MULBERRY SAPLINGS IN FOOT HILLS OF KASHMIR, PROPAGATED THROUGH CUTTINGS UNDER POLYHOUSE CONDITIONS","","Abstract: Mulberry leaf being the sole food for silkworm (Bombyx mori) is usually propagated through root grafting under temperate conditions, because temperate varieties of mulberry are poor rooters. A break through of raising saplings was achieved when cuttings of Goshoerami variety of mulberry under polyhouse were tried for propagation purposes at the Division of Sericulture, Mirgund. The raising of mulberry cuttings through polyhouse technology was tried in the rainfed areas of 09 selected villages of project area of district Baramulla for study purpose, under the propjet entitled, ""Sericulture in foot hills of Kashmir : a source of sustenance of marginal farmers"". The study revealed that more than 50% of survival of saplings was recorded successfully. It was found that uniform distribution of rainfall during the growing period helps in the growth, crop stand and timely sprouting. Adequate multiplication of quality planting material in mulberry will help in raising the availability of raw material of people associated with silk production and augment their income. ### Plant products search: soft fruits ### Programs found: village project ### Topics keywords: sweet potato;planting material;farm size;raw material",2011,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND STATISTICAL SCIENCES,,,,,,,#36226,,"",""
Perspectives on animal production systems in Asia,"","Abstract: Asian animal production systems are discussed in the context of their relevance, types, trends, opportunities for productivity enhancement, and the implications for natural resource management (NRM). These include a variety of systems in agro-ecological zones which can be grouped broadly into one of three categories: landless, crop-based and, and rangeland-based. The landless production systems are of two types: (i) highly industrialised pig and poultry production, and (ii) extensive systems involving small ruminants, cattle and camels and resource-poor nomads, transhumants or agricultural laborers and seasonal migrations. Within crop-based systems, animals are found in both irrigated and rainfed areas. The genesis of these systems is illustrated, and includes two broad categories: systems combining animals with annual or perennial cropping. The significance of crop-animal interactions and economic benefits from 31 case studies in 11 countries highlight the importance of animals in crop-based systems. Animal production trends are influenced by strong demand-led factors such as population growth, urbanisation, income growth and changing consumer preferences These are of two categories: (i) modern, demand-driven and capital intensive non-ruminant (pig and poultry) sector which is dominant, growing, and supplies the major share of animal proteins,which however is unable to meet current and projected human requirements, and (ii) traditional resource-driven and labour intensive ruminant (buffaloes, cattle, goats and sheep) sector which mainly involve small farms and small farmers and are lagging. The disparity questions efficiencies of prevailing animal production systems and NRM. Integrated animals-tree crop production systems are underestimated and are potentially very important. Two possible scenarios for the future of crop-animal systems are increased size and specialisation, and the other disintegration due to population pressure. It is suggested that crop-animal systems and small farms will continue to be predominant in Asia, in which intensification, growth and increased contribution are likely in the future. Major issues to be addressed across systems include inter alia nutrient flows, waste disposal, overgrazing, all year round feeding systems, zoonosis, and policy issues. The less-favored and more constrained rainfed areas can be made more productive through increased public and private sector investments, interdisciplinary research and development, and improved technology application. The challenges and benefits for the future include improved efficiency of NRM, agricultural growth, reduced poverty, improved livelihoods of the poor and environmental sustainability. ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;small ruminant;natural resource;natural resource management;consumer preference;willingness pay;private sector;economic benefit;contract farming;farming system;animal health",2007,,Livestock Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2006.05.005,,#37039,,"",""
Phosphorus micro-dosing as an entry point to sustainable intensification of rice systems in sub-Saharan Africa,"","Abstract: Phosphorus (P) deficiency is a major biophysical limitation to rice grain yields in sub-Saharan Africa, and low-cost P management strategies are needed by smallholder farmers to reverse soil fertility decline. On-station field and pot experiments were combined with on-farm testing to evaluate the effect of P micro-dose placement in dry-seeded, dibbled rice on emergence, early vigour and grain yield. Placing a micro-dose of 3Ð6 kg P ha _1 in the planting hole consistently increased early vigour and grain yield of both a P-efficient and less P-efficient rice genotype. An agronomic efficiency of P fertilizer (AEP) of 356Ð817 kg grains kg _1 P was achieved with a micro-dose of 3 kg P ha _1 . A negative effect on emergence by placing a P micro-dose in the planting hole observed in one experiment was compensated by a higher grain weight per hill. In other experiments, no negative effect on plant emergence under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions and with different P sources was observed even when fertilizers were mixed with seeds. A micro-dose of 20Ð30 kg of DAP ha _1 placed in the planting hole resulted in an average net increase in profit of $91 to $136 ha _1 and benefit:cost ratio of 3Ð12 in on-farm experiments. FarmersÕ appreciation of the technology was positive but lack of credit, availability of appropriate fertilizers in local agrodealers and increased labour requirements were identified as potential constraints for adoption. P micro-dose placement in the planting hole can be used as an entry point towards sustainable intensification in dry-seeded, dibbled rice systems in SSA, provided it is accompanied by institutional support and mechanization options to increase its adoption potential. ### Plant products search: grain;rice ### Programs found: agricultural education program (AEP);agroforestry ecosystem project (AEP);agricultural extension program (AEP) ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Topics keywords: grain weight;CA;soil fertility;factor affecting;net return;SSA;point view;farming system;negative effect;human health;cost ratio;food security;short term;sustainable intensification;plant height;towards sustainable;factor influencing;smallholder farmer;human activity;sustainable agriculture;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2018,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2018.02.016,,#36502,,"",""
Is remote sensing useful for finding and monitoring urban farms?,"","Abstract: As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables in urban areas grows while the difficulty of bringing these perishable products to these areas also increases. Small-scale agriculture located in urban areas is a highly effective and profitable way to provide these products to communities that are far from extensive commercial agricultural areas. Here we describe how remote sensing can be used with data mining approaches to monitor urban and peri-urban farms within cities in both developed and developing countries. Using very high resolution satellite imagery together with moderate and coarse resolution imagery and information from social media and the web, we analyze the usefulness of different methods to identify farms within urban boundaries in four countries. The analysis shows how a mixed-method approach is necessary in order to identify where urban farming is occurring and to monitor its change through time. Although remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices were useful, without ancillary data they are not effective at remotely mapping the locations of urban farms. However, remote sensing is a good way to monitor vegetation condition in locations where actively managed urban farms are known to exist. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe;United States;Senegal ### Plant products search: fruit vegetables;fruits ### Topics keywords: small scale;remote sensing;satellite imagery;developing country;RS;rice straw;GIS;family farming ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND;IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Applied Geography,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.01.008,,#37657,,"",""
Land degradation and population relocation in Northern China,"","Abstract: Overgrazing in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia following market reform in China has led to severe soil degradation and desertification. In an effort to revive the ecological environment in northern pastoral areas, the government of China recently adopted an intervention policy to relocate families from areas where excess grazing pressure was seriously compromising land and the environment. A survey was conducted in three villages to determine how well the relocated families have adapted to their new living conditions and the factors that affect their willingness to stay in the new villages. Regression analysis revealed that the most important factors were age of the head of the household, length of time the family has resided in the new village, proportion of total income that is made up of government payments and level of fixed, durable and current assets. ### Countries mentioned: China;Mongolia ### Topics keywords: regression analysis;land degradation;living condition;survey conducted;LD;rural area;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2012,,Asia Pacific Viewpoint,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8373.2012.01488.x,,#36449,,"",""

N-15 tracer application to evaluate nitrogen dynamics of food webs in two subtropical small-scale aquaculture ponds under different managements,"","Abstract: Small, semi-intensively managed aquaculture ponds contribute significantly to the food security of small-scale farmers around the world. However, little is known about nutrient flows within natural food webs in such ponds in which fish production depends on the productivity of natural food resources. N-15 was applied as ammonium at 1.1 and 0.4% of total nitrogen in a traditionally managed flow-through pond and a semi-intensively managed stagnant pond belonging to small-scale farmers in Northern Vietnam and traced through the natural food resources over 7 days. Small-sized plankton (1-60 mu m) was the dominant pelagic biomass in both ponds with higher biomass in the stagnant pond. This plankton assimilated major portions of the applied tracer and showed a high sedimentation and turnover rate. High re-activation of settled nutrients into the pelagic food web was observed. The tracer was removed more quickly from the flow-through pond than from the stagnant pond. A steady nutrient supply could increase fish production. ### Countries mentioned: Viet Nam ### Animal products search: fish ### Measurements for interventions: nitrogen ### Topics keywords: small scale;TN;NH4;TP;extension service;NO3;small scale farmer;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10256016.2014.922963,,#36294,,"",""
Planning and design procedures suitable for small-scale farmer irrigation projects,"","Abstract: The Water Research Commission has released the results of a study aimed at evaluating existing irrigation techniques and equipment used by small-scale farmers, in an effort to establish design methods and norms that would facilitate the future planning and development of small-scale farmer irrigation projects. The researchers, CT Crosby, M de Lange, CM Stimie and I van der Stoep, all from MBB Consulting Engineers, say that field visits paid to small-farmer irrigation schemes and farms across South Africa afforded the research team an invaluable opportunity for observation and discussion. Evaluations of irrigation systems were carried out in the field during normal operation and the team came to realise that the purely technical evaluation of irrigation systems as a basis for design norms is not enough. It is essential to adopt a participatory ""bottom up"" approach to irrigation planning. However, technical aspects remain important and the successful development of small-scale farmer irrigation in South Africa requires exceptionally high technical and organisational proficiency on the part of planners, designers and implementing agencies. Small-scale irrigation farmers in the communal land tenure areas can be categorised in terms of their water supply, namely: • farmers on irrigation schemes; • vegetable gardeners (served by communal water supply infrastructures), and • independent farmers, each with a ""private"" water supply. The researchers say a further distinction should be made between full-time and part-time farmers, in order to understand the technology requirements. Irrigated agriculture is almost invariably aimed at generating a cash income or at least replacing expenditure on food through own production. Even individuals growing vegetables in community gardens normally only use a small portion of their produce for home consumption. The bulk is sold to augment the family income. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: vegetables ### Programs found: development small scale irrigation (SSI) project;farm irrigation project;small scale irrigation (SSI) project;scale irrigation project;small scale farmer (SSF) irrigation project;irrigation project;development small scale farmer (SSF) irrigation project ### Topics keywords: irrigated agriculture;drought stress;land degradation;CA;water saving;SA;chicken manure;conventional tillage;NT;long term;small scale;land reform;crop rotation;conservation tillage;soil organic carbon;carbon storage;land tenure;irrigation scheme;organic fertilizer;small scale irrigation scheme;ecosystem service;extension service;crop residue;small scale farmer;CT;cattle manure ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2001,,SA Waterbulletin,,,,,,,#37047,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-22 01:23:09)(Screen): No counterfactual.; ,""

Seven different strains of Bacillus were isolated from cotton rhizosphere soil near boys' hostel of Palamuru University which belongs to Deccan plateau. Among seven isolated strains, Bacillus strain-7 has shown maximum support for good growth of eight cotton cultivars. This bacterial species is named Bacillus sp. PU-7 based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic analysis. Among eight cotton cultivars, Mahyco has shown high levels of IAA, proteins, chlorophyll, sugars and low level of proline. Efficacy of novel Bacillus sp. PU-7 with Mahyco cultivar has been checked experimentally at field level in four different cotton grown agricultural soils. The strains supported plant growth in almost all the cases, especially in the deep black soil, with a clear evidence of maximum plant growth by increased levels of phytohormone production and biochemical analysis, followed by shallow black soil. Hence, it is inferred that the novel isolate can be used as bioinoculant in the cotton fields. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: cotton ### Topics keywords: AMF;GM;PGPR;chemical fertilizer;plant growth promoting;PSB;bio fertilizer;bt cotton;FYM;pest control;biological control;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,3 BIOTECH,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13205-013-0154-0,,#37213,,"",""
Plant Nutrition: From Liquid Medium to Micro-farm,"","Abstract: Soil fertility and plant nutrition have played an important role in the agricultural science during the twentieth century in increasing crop yields. In the twenty-first century, importance of this field is still expanding due to the limitations of natural land and water resources, sustainable agriculture, and concern about environmental pollution. Under these conditions, improving food supply worldwide with adequate quantity and quality is fundamental. Supply of adequate mineral nutrients in adequate amount and proportion to higher plants will certainly determine such accomplishments. Further, in developing crop production technologies, research work under field and controlled conditions is necessary to generate basic and applied information. In addition, research is very dynamic and complex due to variation in climatic, soil, and plant factors and their interactions. This demands that basic research information can only be obtained under controlled conditions to avoid or reduce effects of environmental factors on treatments. Hence, the objective of this review article is to discuss basic principles of research in soil fertility and plant nutrition under different conditions from to liquid or solid media, micro-farm, green house and field experiments. These information will be included the management of different tools of plant nutrition even on the small or large scale i.e., Petri dishes (in case of medium) or hectare unit (in case of fields). Topics discussed are soil and solution culture experimental techniques including, fertilizer application and planting, experimental duration and observations, considerations of pot or field experimentations. ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;drought stress;chemical fertilizer;winter wheat;soil fertility;human health;growing season;SA;environmental pollution;large scale;sustainable agriculture;field experiment",2014,,SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 14: AGROECOLOGY AND GLOBAL CHANGE,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-06016-3_12,,#36301,,"",""
Plant population and spatial arrangement study on the intercropping of maize and beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in northeast Brazil.,"","Abstract: In northeast Brazil, the peasant farmers usually raise their crops in mixture, and the intercropping of maize and beans is common. In order to examine plant populations and spatial arrangements of maize/bean intercrops, an experiment was carried out at Filadelfia, Brazil. The statistical design was a randomized complete block with a split plot arrangement, with four replications. Four population levels of maize (25,000, 50,000, 75,000, and 100,000 plants/ha) and beans (150,000, 200,000, 250,000, and 300,000 plants/ha) formed the main plots. The subplots were composed of five spatial arrangements (sole maize; 1M:2B; 1M:3B; 1M:4B; and sole beans.)

Policy-driven rubber plantation and its driving factors: a case of smallholders in northeast Thailand,"","Abstract: Government-promoted rubber plantation has led to widespread land conversion to monoculture rubber cultivation in northeast Thailand. To understand what household characteristics influence the decision for land conversion from traditional rice and upland crops cultivation and its impacts on sustainability, the study was conducted in Nong Khai and Bueng Kan provinces of northeast Thailand by analyzing land-use changes between 2002 and 2013. Majority of conversion to rubber took place in paddy-growing areas and the economic returns from rubber along with institutional support from the government played a key role in encouraging farmers to convert to rubber. Other household characteristics, such as farmers’ experiences, age of household head, land security, size of paddy area owned, and off-farm income were important factors influencing the conversion. The reduction of paddy fields may be associated with an increased risk of food insecurity of smallholders. Spatial analysis showed that 76% of new rubber plantations currently are in environmentally unsuitable marginal areas, which are otherwise important for biodiversity conservation, watershed function, and environmental protection. The study findings will help to clarify the influencing factors on land conversion to rubber plantation and to highlight some of the environmental issues for developing sustainable extension strategies to ensure food security, reduce poverty and protect the environment from rubber plantation. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: poverty project ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;natural resource;influencing factor;LUC;environmental impact;agroforestry system;paddy field;land use change;environmental protection;cultivated land;protected area;biodiversity conservation;food security;animal husbandry;ecosystem service;food insecurity;sustainable development;land use;specie richness;factor influencing;ensure food security;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2016.1143410,,#36393,,"",""
Which farmers benefit most from sustainable intensification? An ex-ante impact assessment of expanding grain legume production in Malawi,"","Abstract: Legume technologies are widely promoted among smallholders in southern Africa, providing an opportunity for sustainable intensification. Farms and farming strategies of smallholders differ greatly within any given locality and determine the opportunities for uptake of technologies. We provide an ex-ante assessment of the impact of grain legumes on different types of farms and identify niches for grain legumes in Malawi. After creation of a farm typology, detailed farm characterisations were used to describe the farming system. The characterisations provided the basis for the construction of simplified, virtual farms on which possible scenarios for expanding and intensifying grain legume production were explored using the farm-scale simulation model NUANCES-FARMSIM. Observed yields and labour inputs suggested that maize provides more edible yield per unit area with a higher calorific value and greater labour use efficiency than groundnut and soybean. Crop yields simulated by the model partly confirmed these yield trends, but at farm level maize-dominated systems often produced less food than systems with more grain legumes. Improved management practices such as addition of P-based fertiliser to grain legumes and inoculation of soybean were crucial to increase biological nitrogen fixation and grain yields of legumes and maize, and created systems with increased area of legumes that were more productive than the current farms. Improved legume management was especially a necessity for low resource endowed farmers who, due to little past use of P-based fertiliser and organic inputs, have soils with a poorer P status than wealthier farmers. Economic analyses suggested that legume cultivation was considerably more profitable than continuous maize cropping. Highest potential net benefits were achieved with tobacco, but the required financial investment made tobacco cultivation riskier. Grain legumes have excellent potential as food and cash crops particularly for medium and high resource endowed farmers, a role that could grow in importance as legume markets further develop. For low resource endowed farmers, legumes can improve food self-sufficiency of households, but only if legumes can be managed with P fertiliser and inoculation in the case of soybean. Given that low resource endowed farmers tend to be risk averse and have few resources to invest, the ability of poorer farmers to adopt legume technologies could be limited. ### Countries mentioned: Malawi ### Plant products search: tobacco;soybeans;maize;groundnuts;grain;grain legumes ### Topics keywords: cover crop;sustainable intensification;cropping system;CA;rural household;self sufficiency;use efficiency;cash crop;grain legume;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;farming system;management practice;grain yield;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2014,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2014.04.002,,#36572,,Nicola Randall (2019-06-06 20:57:02)(Screen): no mention of water scarcity or interventions specifically linked to overcoming water scarcity so have excluded; ,Observational; interventions; livestock
Malawi: food security issues and challenges for the 1990s.,"","Abstract: Malawi's economy depends primarily on agriculture: the rural economy provides income for 85% of the 8.5 million population. Malawi currently faces a number of food security issues: declining per capita production; malnutrition; increasing land pressure; rising agricultural input prices; and limited access to food within some households. The household food insecurity problem can be broken down into rural and urban food insecurity. In the rural areas as a result of small farm size and low cash incomes limiting access to improved technology and to food, many poorer adults suffer from seasonal under-nutrition and 50% of rural children are chronically malnourished. In the urban areas, families on a fixed income have experienced a gradual erosion of their purchasing power as a result of increasing maize costs and inflation. In response, the government is: (1) encouraging increased productivity in the smallholder and estate sectors by providing agricultural inputs and farm services and increasing the scope and efficiency of extension, marketing and credit services; (2) discouraging cultivation of new areas paying attention to conservation, watershed management and afforestation projects on already farmed land; (3) setting up a strategic grain reserve; (4) increasing access to food by raising productivity of smallholders thus improving on-farm consumption and, in the urban areas, by raising the minimum wage; (5) setting up a feeding programme for malnourished children; and (6) establishing a Food Security and Nutrition Unit to monitor the situation. Anticipated problems are: removing supply constraints by providing production incentives; population control; targetting assistance to nutritionally vulnerable groups; and providing fertilizer on a timely basis at reasonable prices. ### Countries mentioned: Malawi ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Programs found: afforestation project;feeding program ### Measurements for interventions: rural economy ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;household food insecurity;rural community;rural household;rural tourism;household food security;rural economy;rural development;farm size;rural area;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1990,,"Food security policies in the SADCC region.

Modeling of Pathogen Indicator Organisms in a Small-Scale Agricultural Catchment Using SWAT,"","Abstract: Degradation of water quality from microbial contaminants associated with agricultural activities has significant implications for source protection of potable water. Novel environmental approaches must be adopted to assess risks from waterborne pathogenic microbes. The objective of this study was to evaluate applicability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to predict daily concentrations of E. coli in a small-scale agricultural catchment in Ireland. The study area is based on the Kilshanvey catchment located in the west of Ireland. E. coli data (n = 25) from June 2006 to June 2007 were utilized for comparison with the model's predictions. Statistical analysis indicates an unsatisfactory to fair level of correlation for the model's predictions (R2 = 0.03-0.35, NSE = -0.42-0.29). A sensitivity analysis identified direct stream deposition and die-off rates for E. coli as having a significant impact on the model's predictions. Our results suggest that the model is adequate to assess the magnitude of various microbial sources within catchments but capability to replicate daily observations is uncertain. However, model outputs could provide adequate data to develop a human exposure assessment to pathogen indicator organisms in surface water and assist policy-makers in developing appropriate risk management strategies. ### Countries mentioned: Ireland ### Topics keywords: small scale;land use change;natural resource;SWAT;significant difference;willingness pay;BMP;decision making;statistical analysis;contract farming;assessment tool;policy maker ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2013,,Human and Ecological Risk Assessment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2012.701983,,#37617,,"",""
Modeling the influence of tile drainage flow and tile spacing on phosphorus losses from two agricultural fields in southern Quebec,"","Abstract: Tile drainage is a widely adopted water management practice in the eastern Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. It aims to improve the productivity of poorly drained agricultural fields. Nevertheless, studies have also shown that subsurface drainage is a significant pollution pathway to surface water. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of tile drain spacing on surface runoff, subsurface drainage flows, and phosphorus (P) loss from two tile-drained agricultural fields located near Bedford, Quebec. Field data were used with the DRAINMOD model, and in developed regression models in order to perform the analysis. Both DRAINMOD and the regression models showed good performance. Simulation results indicated that when lateral tile drain spacing is increased, the volume of subsurface drain flow decreases, and the volume of surface runoff increases, at sites with sandy and clay loam soils. For every 5 m increase in drain spacing, total phosphorus (TP) loads in subsurface drainage decreased by 6% at a site with sandy loam soil, and increased by 20% at a site with clay loam soil. TP loads in surface runoff increased as a result of increased drain spacing. ### Countries mentioned: Canada;United States;United Kingdom ### Measurements for interventions: phosphorus ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;tillage practice;total phosphorus;bulk density;total porosity;TP;NT;surface runoff;management practice ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2013,,WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2166/wqrjc.2013.053,,#37301,,"",""
More than trees! Understanding the agroforestry adoption gap in subsistence agriculture: insights from narrative walks in Kenya.,"","Abstract: Agroforestry can contribute to the mitigation of climate change while delivering multiple benefits to sub-Saharan farmers who are exposed to climate variability, land degradation, water scarcity, high disease burden and persistent poverty. But adoption is slow. Based on a critical problem solving approach and grounded theory as a strategy, we study agroforestry and subsistence agriculture as integrated, yet separate, socio-ecological systems with different organisational logics and temporal dynamics. Using 'narrative walks' as a qualitative method to construct grounded data, we explore the social and natural dimensions of the complex, diverse and uncertain landscape and life-worlds of subsistence agriculture. In the grounded analysis, we clarify how social stratification constructs incentives and disincentives to adopt agroforestry. To exemplify, food secure and opportunity seeking farmers may invest land and labour in trees, nurseries and social networks while risk evading farmers are constrained by the 'food imperative', the 'health imperative' and poverty in and of itself. By recognising material, symbolic and relational aspects we show how the ontology of global policies focussing on the merits of agroforestry differs from the ontology of everyday practices and strategies in subsistence agriculture. Such ontological stratification constitutes another constraint to agroforestry adoption as a comprehensive form of socio-technological change. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;social capital;climate change;cover crop;land degradation;water saving;growing season;social network;LD;water scarcity;food secure;climate variability;human activity;CC;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2013,,Journal of Rural Studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.04.004,,#36198,,"",""
"Transforming ground water markets into powerful instruments of small farmer development: lessons from the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.","","Abstract: The paper initiates a discussion on the working of groundwater markets in India; analyzes information available on salient features of groundwater markets in three Indian states; and considers policies that could transform groundwater markets into powerful instruments for promoting agricultural growth in general and the interests of the rural poor in particular. The economics of the demand and supply of groundwater are examined, indicating that groundwater prices are extraordinarily high in Gujarat compared to the other states. In Gujarat public policy towards groundwater development has served to enhance the monopoly power of private water extraction mechanisms. Water buyers, largely the resource poor, would gain substantially from lower prices and greater supplies of groundwater. This could be achieved by reducing the incremental costs of water extraction by lowering the price of electricity for pumping. Such a power pricing policy would also lead to fuller utilization of privately created minor irrigation potential and would help establish a just and equitable system for groundwater development. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: contract farming;agro food;public policy;family farming ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1985,,"Irrigation Management Network Paper, Agricultural Administration Unit, Overseas Development Institute, UK",,,,,,,#36420,,"Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-06 08:14:44)(Screen): smallholder not explicitly mentioned, but it does talk about ""rural poor"", hence included; ",Observational; interventions; livestock
Multicriteria Decision Aid methodology as a tool for evaluation of maize cropping systems.,"","Abstract: Conforming to the principles of sustainable development is one of the great challenges of agricultural research when designing and adapting technologies that guarantee at the same time economic profitability to rural settlements and lower negative environmental impacts. However, for farmers, the choice of technologies is a complex decision that seeks to meet several and, many times, conflicting objectives. In order to develop viable and sustainable proposals, it is fundamental to understand the criteria that guide the farmers' decisions to evaluate the proposed technologies. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential of Multicriteria Decision Aid (MCDA) in the analysis of maize-based cropping systems (dryland farming of grain maize) for family farms based on a multicriteria model developed with agrarian reform settlers of the municipal district of Unaí, state of MG, Brazil. The MCDA allowed to systematize a robust set of quantitative and qualitative criteria for the analysis of the cropping systems and showed that the farmers' evaluation is of wider scope than that based on productivity, which is the one usually considered as the main criterion of technology evaluation. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Topics keywords: land reform;sustainable development;cropping system;environmental impact;rural tourism;rural settlement;agrarian reform;rural area ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2012,,T,,,,,,,#36408,,"",""

Disease threats to sheep associated with intensification of pastoral farming.,"","Abstract: Sheep farming in New Zealand is based on an outdoor grazing system with various systems of grazing management utilised depending on the type of farm and the time of year. In the current grazing systems, periods of high stocking density, sometimes combined with poor husbandry, contribute to infectious diseases such as abortion and salmonellosis. Intensification such as housing or intensive stocking of ewes for lambing, or feedlot systems, are unlikely to become common in sheep production in New Zealand. However, should these be utilised on individual farms there is likely to be in an increase in diseases such as coccidiosis, bacterial diseases of lambs, cryptosporidiosis and mastitis. In any management system involving high stocking densities, careful husbandry is essential to minimise the transmission of infectious diseases. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Animal products search: lamb meat ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;human health;infectious disease;animal health;stocking density ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2008,,New Zealand Veterinary Journal,,,,,,,#37498,,"",""
North Otago soils: physical properties and nutrient requirements for economic production.,"","Abstract: North Otago soils, New Zealand are all of sedimentary origin but range in topography from flat alluvial and terrace soils to hill soils. Most of the farmed soils are yellow-grey earths on the rolling downlands or plains. Yellow-grey earths on the downlands have dense subsoils that limit water movement during wet winters and rooting depth during dry summers. Plains soils have shallow depths to gravels limiting water holding capacity and making irrigation necessary for intensive pastoral production. The relationships between soil nutrient levels and pasture production has been shown to be of the diminishing returns type. Soil nutrient levels for near maximum pasture production on North Otago soils are Olsen P 20-25, sulfate-S 10-12, organic-S 15-20 and quick test K 5-8. At high stocking rates profitable responses in pasture and animal production can still be gained at higher Olsen P levels.

OPTIMIZING TEMPERATURE IN MUSHROOM DRYING [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Mushroom slices after blanching were dried using heated air at 45, 55, 65, 75, 85 and 95C to about 5% moisture content. Organoleptic evaluation of mushroom soup and rehydrated slices, browning index indicative of color and the rehydration quality were used to establish safe temperature for drying mushroom. A hot-air drying temperature of 65C was found to produce a product of desirable quality that was also acceptable to consumers. Mushroom dried at 65C had a rehydration ratio of 2.9. Thin-layer drying apparatus using heated air for drying is a technical advancement that provides a low cost drying option for communities with restricted budgets. Optimizing temperature that is safe for human consumption and acceptable to consumer is achieved significantly through this drying process, which is the ultimate purpose of producing processed foods. The study is anticipated to help small farmers of developing and under-developing countries, particularly of hilly regions, with inadequate transport facilities and far away from road connectivity to save their perishables from complete deterioration. This may also encourage small entrepreneurs to establish their drying units in regions far away from fresh markets. Systems using locally available fuels from agricultural waste or from nearby forests may be developed for heating ambient air for drying small batches.

"Evaluation of food attractants in the capture of the Mexican fruit fly (Diptera: Tephritidae) in Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico.","","Abstract: McPhail traps baited with national and imported commercial food attractants (ten hydrolysed proteins and yeasts used in food manufacturing) and three natural byproducts including molasses, fermented pineapple peel, and sugar water were evaluated for their ability to capture native adults of the Mexican fruit fly in citrus and mango orchards and sterile flies in another mango orchard. The orchards were located in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico. The food attractants Torula yeast, Bayer protein, hydrolysed protein (Prothidex), inactive yeast (Azteca), and the hydrolysed protein Staley (SIB-7) were most effective in the capture of wild and sterile flies in citrus and mango orchards. Other solid and liquid national hydrolysed proteins demonstrated intermediate efficiency in the capture of the Mexican fruit fly. Fermented pineapple peel, with an intermediate capture index, has great potential for poor farmers because of its low cost and high availability. In the citrus experiment the Bayer protein was a poor attractant of adult fruit flies. However, in both mango experiments the Bayer protein was a good fly attractant. In all experiments, molasses resulted in limited attraction of flies, perhaps due to the stock used in the experiments. Further, improvement of fruit fly attraction of national hydrolysed proteins in Latin American countries with a local food processing industry will allow the development of lower cost attractants for monitoring adults of the Mexican fruit fly and perhaps also the use of those proteins mixed with insecticides for the attract and kill technology. Pineapple juice could also be a bait option for small fruit producers. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico;Germany ### Plant products search: pineapples;mangoes;citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: IPM;insect pest;processing industry;raw material ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",2005,,Manejo Integrado de Plagas y Agroecología,,,,,,,#37590,,"",""

The primary goal of this research was to prove and demonstrate the ability of IS to evaluate soil properties and quality across anthropogenically induced land-use changes. This aim was fulfilled by developing and implementing a spectral soil quality index (SSQI) using IS obtained by a laboratory and field spectrometer (point scale) as well as by airborne hyperspectral imaging (local scale), in two experimental sites located in Israel and Germany. In this regard, 13 soil physical, biological, and chemical properties and their derived soil quality index (SQI) were measured. Several mathematical/statistical procedures, consisting of a series of operations, including a principal component analysis (PCA), a partial least squares-regression (PLS-R), and a partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), were used. Correlations between the laboratory spectral values and the calculated SQI coefficient of determination (R) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) were R=0.84; RPD=2.43 and R=0.78; RPD=2.10 in the Israeli and the German study sites, respectively. The PLS-DA model that was used to develop the SSQI showed high classification accuracy in both sites (from laboratory, field, and imaging spectroscopy). The correlations between the SSQI and the SQI were R=0.71 and R=0.7, in the Israeli and the German study sites, respectively. It is concluded that soil quality can be effectively monitored using the spectral-spatial information provided by the IS technology. IS-based classification of soils can provide the basis for a spatially explicit and quantitative approach for monitoring SQ and function at a local scale. ### Countries mentioned: Germany;Israel ### Topics keywords: land use change;spatial distribution;bulk density;trace element;principal component;CA;soil fertility;land use;LUC;principal component analysis;chemical property;organic matter;factor affecting;PCA ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Remote Sensing,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs71115748,,#37407,,"",""
A bibliography on rural land subdivision for smallholding land uses in Australia.,"","Abstract: The bibliography lists the papers, reports, etc. on the subdivision of rural land for smallholding land uses published in Australia over recent years. It also lists a number of papers, reports, etc. published in New Zealand, Canada and the USA, as some of the experience of these countries is relevant to the Australian situation. There has been a large amount of subdivision of rural lands into smallholding units in the metropolitan regions of Australia and their hinterlands since World War II, particularly during the last ten years. Much of the demand for these smallholdings has come from persons living and working in the urban areas who wish to shift to a nearby rural residence or hobby-farm and commute to work in the urban areas or to have a weekend hobby-farm/rural retreat, or to retire. This demand reflects the prosperity of many urban households and the mobility provided by the motor car. The non use of many of the new smallholdings also indicates that there has been a significant speculative component in the demand. On the supply side, the declining profitability of some of the main rural industries of Australia has encouraged farmers to sell their farms for subdivision. ### Countries mentioned: Australia;United States;Canada;New Zealand ### Topics keywords: agro food;point view;chemical composition ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1979,,"Public Administration Series, Vance Bibliographies",,,,,,,#36579,,"",""
Assisted natural regeneration accelerates recovery of highly disturbed rainforest,"","Abstract: Large areas of rainforests in Australia and other tropical regions have been extensively cleared since the mid-19th century. As abandoned agro-pastoral land becomes increasingly prominent, there is an ongoing need to identify cost-effective approaches to reinstate forest on these landscapes. Assisted regeneration is a potentially lower cost restoration approach which aims to accelerate forest recovery by removing barriers to natural regeneration. However, despite being widely used its ecological benefits are poorly quantified, particularly on long cleared and grazed land. This study quantified the benefits of assisted regeneration on previously cleared land in a subtropical rainforest ecosystem within eastern Australia. Three different site types were used (grazed, grazing excluded and grazing excluded plus assisted regeneration, each with a maximum distance of 120 m to remnant forest) to compare forest recovery up to 10 years after grazing was relieved with and without 4–6 years of assisted regeneration. Assisted regeneration sites showed a threefold increase in canopy cover, fourfold increase in native tree and shrub species richness and over 40 times greater native stem density compared to nonassisted regeneration sites. Stimulation of native recruitment appears dependent on the simultaneous removal of multiple barriers to regeneration, with the exclusion of grazing alone insufficient. This demonstrates the additional ecological benefits arising from investment in assisted regeneration. It offers considerable promise as a cost-effective tool for accelerating and improving reinstatement of forest on retired agro-pastoral land in the humid subtropics. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: cover crop;specie richness;BMP;cost effective;economic benefit;pest control;CC ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Ecological Management and Restoration,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/emr.12277,,#36821,,"",""
Changing resource values in Australia's tropical savannas: priorities in institutional reform.,"","Abstract: This paper argues that rapid changes in both market and non-market resource values in Australia's tropical savannas are propelling a major shift in land ownership and land tenure institutions. Changing resource values are leading to a sharper regional differentiation between: core pastoral regions with only modest changes in resource use and land tenure; marginal regions experiencing rapid change in values, uses and tenures; and urban-oriented development regions. Institutional change has been occurring in a piecemeal manner, with inadequate attention to underlying causes, current trends and long term outcomes. A more systematic, informed approach is needed to ensure an effective match of property rights (and use rights) with resource use, including: (1) clearer specification of the rights of both title holders and non-title holders whether on Aboriginal or on other tenures; (2) more attention to mechanisms for assisting land use change; and (3) possible creation of a new form of public tenure capable of accommodating private use rights. In keeping with an enhanced public role in resource allocation and conflict avoidance, there is a growing need for strategic regional planning, focusing mainly on marginal regions and urban development regions. Strategic planning needs to be linked to changing land tenures and uses as well as to more informed and sensitive approaches to environmental, economic and social impact assessment. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: land use change;land reform;land degradation;LUC;land use;land ownership;property right;land tenure;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1996,,The future of tropical savannas: an Australian perspective.,,,,,,,#36560,,"",""
Combining satellite data with a simulation model to describe spatial variability in pasture growth at a farm scale.,"","Abstract: Practical application of simulation modelling as a decision aid for grazing system management usually involves an assumption of uniformity of model inputs over a farm paddock or property. In reality, paddocks and farms display high spatial variability in model inputs. There is considerable interest in assessing the significance of this spatial variability for animal production and enterprise profitability. This study seeks to demonstrate the use of spatial data with the GRAZPLAN pasture model to provide estimates of annual net primary production from pastures at a farm scale on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The GRAZPLAN pasture model was validated against data from 2 separate field experiments for a typical improved pasture based on from 1968 to 1972. A spatial coverage, classifying paddocks into 9 pasture types based on a botanical survey, was used to define the pasture parameter sets used in simulations. A Landsat TM satellite image classified to give 3 pasture growth status classes was used to define within-paddock levels of a fertility index used in the simulation model. Simulations over 1975-94 were conducted for all combinations of pasture types and fertility scalar values using climate data for the CSIRO Pastoral Research Laboratory near Armidale. Simulation output was written to a lookup table and imported into a PC-based geographic information system. The spatial data layers were combined to form a display template representing spatial variation in pasture type, pasture condition and fertility. The spatial template was reclassified using the lookup tables to create maps of annual net primary production from pastures. Spatial variability in simulated annual net primary production was greater for the paddocks with diverse mixtures of sown and native species than for the more uniform highly improved or pure native pastures. The difference in response to rainfall of simulated net primary production was greater between different pasture types than between different levels of the fertility index. The resulting maps provide a demonstration of the way in which satellite imagery and other data can be interfaced with a decision support system to provide information for use in precision management of grazing systems. Implementation of such methods as a management tool will depend on development of quantitative spatial data layers which provide accurate and repeatable initial conditions and parameter values for simulation models. ### Countries mentioned: Australia;United Kingdom ### Programs found: program coordinator (PC) ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;remote sensing;satellite imagery;chemical composition;decision support system;protein content;principal component;winter wheat;geographical information system;trace metal;traditional medicine;precision agriculture;satellite image;geographic information system;decision making;spatial variability;medicinal plant;decision support;spatial distribution;trace element;growing season;spatial variation;GIS;field experiment ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1999,,Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/EA98109,,#36400,,"",""
"Disturbance-dependent invasion of the woody weed, <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Calotropis procera</i>, in Australian rangelands.","","Abstract: Plant invasions are threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes that have far reaching ecological and economic impacts. Understanding the mechanisms of invasion essentially helps in developing effective management strategies. Rubber bush is an introduced milkweed that invades Australian beef production rangelands. Its establishment is often associated with disturbances caused by pastoral management practices. We examined whether or not rubber bush (1) outcompetes native grasses, (2) can invade intact rangeland, and (3) if disturbance facilitates rubber bush establishment and spread in grassy rangelands. We measured the competitive response of different densities of Mitchell grass individuals and the competitive effects of associate rubber bush seedlings in an additive common garden experiment. Replicated field exclosure experiments, under grass-dominated and tropical savanna woodland conditions examined the effect of increasing levels of disturbance on rubber bush seedling emergence. The dominant native Mitchell grass was a stronger competitor than rubber bush when grown together under greenhouse conditions, whereby root and shoot biomass yields were more restricted in rubber bush compared with Mitchell grass. This finding was corroborated in the field exclosure experiments at both sites, where seedling emergence increased 5-fold in seeded and highly disturbed plots where superficial soils were turned over by treatments simulating heavy grazing and trampling by cattle or machinery. Emergence of rubber bush seedlings in seeded plots that were undisturbed, clipped and grazed was minimal and rubber bush seedlings did not survive the seedling stage in these plots. These results demonstrate that disturbance to the superficial soil stratum affects the ability of rubber bush seeds to successfully establish in a microsite, and high levels of soil disturbance substantially increase establishment. Thus, rubber bush is a poor competitor of Mitchell grass and does not invade intact grassland. Consequently, rubber bush invasion is disturbance-dependent in the vast Australian rangelands. The spread of this weed may be arrested by management practices that minimise disturbances to grass cover. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Animal products search: beef ### Topics keywords: plant height;management practice;drought stress ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Rangeland Journal,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/RJ16120,,#37044,,"",""
Factors affecting adoption of improved management practices in the pastoral industry in Great Barrier Reef catchments.,"","Abstract: Substantial efforts are being made by industry and government in Australia to reduce adverse impacts of pastoral operations on water quality draining to the Great Barrier Reef. A key target is to achieve rapid adoption of better management practices by landholders, but current theoretical frameworks provide limited guidance about priorities for improving adoption. In this study information from direct surveys with landholders in the two largest catchments draining into the Great Barrier Reef has been collected and analysed. Study outcomes have important implications for policy settings, because they confirm that substantial variations in adoption drivers exist across landholders, enterprises and practices. The results confirm that the three broad barriers to adoption of information gaps, financial incentives and risk perceptions are relevant. This implies that different policy mechanisms, including extension and incentive programs, remain important, although financial incentives were only identified as important to meet capital and transformational costs rather than recurrent costs. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Programs found: financial incentive (FIT) program;incentive program ### Topics keywords: factor affecting;management practice;risk assessment ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,,,,,#37348,,"",""
Fire experiments in northern Australia: contributions to ecological understanding and biodiversity conservation in tropical savannas.,"","Abstract: The management of fire in savannas has been informed by a strong tradition of fire experiments, especially in Africa. This research tradition is much shorter in the 2 million square kilometres of tropical savannas in northern Australia, but has yielded several natural experiments, and three designed, manipulative, controlled field experiments (hereafter 'manipulative' experiments) of international significance (at Munmarlary, Kapalga and Kidman Springs in the Northern Territory). Here we assess the contributions of experiments, in particular the manipulative experiments, to ecological understanding and biodiversity management in Australia's savannas. Running from 1973 to 1996, the Munmarlary experiment comprised hectare-scale experimental plots with four replicated dry season fire treatments, and was designed to examine interactions between fire, landscape and biodiversity. The Kapalga experiment ran from 1989 to 1995, with a range of fire treatments broadly similar to those at Munmarlary. However, experimental units were 10-20 km sub-catchments, making it one of the largest, replicated fire experiments ever conducted. The Kidman Springs experiment focused on grass-layer productivity and composition to meet the needs of the pastoral industry, but also provided an opportunity to examine biodiversity responses to different fire regimes. Methodologically, the experiments have generally focused on phenomena - the responses to different fire treatments of individual taxa - rather than on mechanisms that determine response syndromes. They have highlighted that a range of responses to differences in fire regime is possible, and that no single fire regime can optimise all biodiversity outcomes. For effective conservation of biodiversity in the face of such complexity, conservation goals will need to be made explicit. The existing portfolio of manipulative experiments is incomplete, lacking especially a consideration of some critical savanna taxa and environments, and providing little information on the significance of spatial and temporal variability in fire patterns, especially at small scales. An understanding of fire in Australian savanna landscapes remains inadequate, so there is a continuing need for close partnerships between scientists and conservation managers, with fire management treated as a series of landscape experiments in an adaptive management framework. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: small scale;nitrogen fertilizer;ecosystem service;food insecurity;spatial distribution;winter wheat;specie richness;growing season;protected area;field experiment;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity;biodiversity conservation;NT ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2003,,International Journal of Wildland Fire,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/WF03025,,#36659,,"",""
Fire regimes and woody biomass dynamics in Australian savannas.,"","Abstract: Aim: Many tropical savannas are undergoing a trend of increasing woody biomass, or 'woody thickening'. Management to reduce fire frequency and intensity in savannas could substantially increase the amount of carbon stored in woody biomass. We addressed two questions: (1) are northern Australian savannas thickening; and (2) to what extent, and by what demographic processes, does fire affect woody biomass accumulation? Location: Three large national parks, covering 24,000 km, in monsoonal northern Australia. Methods: We examined changes in woody biomass carbon stocks - inferred from tree basal area and the density of woody understorey plants - over a 10-year period in 136 savanna monitoring plots. We statistically assessed these changes in relation to fire frequency and severity. We used a meta-analysis to identify general trends in woody cover in Australian savannas over the last half-century. Results: Woody biomass carbon stocks were relatively stable across the three national parks, but rates of change were statistically indistinguishable from earlier findings of a weak thickening trend. Change was negatively correlated with fire frequency, particularly the frequency of severe fires. High frequencies of severe fires decreased rates of accumulation of biomass by existing trees (through reductions in tree growth and death of individual stems), rather than whole-tree mortality and suppression of recruitment. However, across northern Australia, our meta-analysis identified a general, albeit weak, trend of woody thickening. Main conclusions: The drivers of northern Australia's weak thickening trend are uncertain, but likely candidates include increasing atmospheric CO concentration and water availability, and pastoral intensification. We demonstrate that changes to fire management have the potential to either increase or decrease rates of woody thickening relative to any underlying trend. Understanding how savanna fires affect woody biomass, and how fire effects are mediated by climate and CO, are essential research priorities to predict the fate of savannas. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: land use change;CO;national park;soil organic carbon;protected area;CO2;agroforestry system;carbon stock ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Journal of Biogeography,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.12204,,#36559,,"",""
Management impacts on structure and function of sown grasslands.,"","Abstract: Changes in the flora in intensively grazed grasslands, effects of management on invertebrates, management and ecosystem productivity and nutrient cycling in intensively grazed pastures are discussed and illustrated with data from sown perennial grasslands grazed throughout the yr by sheep at 3 stocking rates from the Armidale sites. Between 1964 and 1973 at Armidale there was an interaction between grazing intensity and climate and progressive changes in the flora which were different for each stocking rate. At the highest stocking rate there was a reduction in dominant perennial grass spp. which was accelerated by drought. At the lowest stocking rates the reduction in dominant perennial grasses by drought was followed by recovery in more favourable yr. The post-drought recovery phase was marked by an increase in annual grasses particularly at the highest stocking rate. Simulation models for studying the effects of the introduction of new pasture spp., fertilizers and irrigation or of increases in domestic animal numbers and herbage conservation on domestic animal production are considered. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: DM;stocking rate;dairy farm;beef cattle ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1980,,"Grasslands, systems analysis and man.",,,,,,,#36376,,"",""
Maximising the use of soil water by herbaceous species in the high rainfall zone of southern Australia: a review.,"","Abstract: The planting of deep-rooted pasture species, herbaceous shrubs, and trees has been widely recommended to reduce deep drainage and recharge to the groundwater in the high rainfall zone (HRZ). However, in more recent years, the value of perennial pastures to reduce recharge has been questioned in areas with &gt;600 mm annual rainfall. Currently, pastures dominated by annual species with relatively low productivity occur across much of the HRZ where deep drainage is most likely contributing to recharge. This review outlines the current understanding of water use by various herbaceous species, and indicates ways in which their water use may be increased in the HRZ of southern Australia (Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales). To reduce deep drainage in the HRZ, the soil water deficit must be increased prior to the opening autumn rains. This will allow a greater storage of water before any potential deep drainage occurs. There are two ways that this can be achieved with the use of herbaceous species. Firstly, change to or encourage species that use more water annually. Although plants with deeper root systems including lucerne have the ability to dry the soil to depth, a combination of winter- and summer-active species, rotational grazing, and pasture spelling would extend the active growing season and soil water use of annual and perennial species. A second option is to increase the productivity of the pasture, as there is a direct link between growth and water use. For example, improving pasture productivity by 50%, say from 8 to 12 t dry matter/ha, could use (transpire) approximately 160 mm more water annually by a C species, irrespective of evaporation from the soil surface or evaporative demand factors. This is supported by strong correlations between plant dry mass and water use among a wide range of C and C plants of diverse growth form and habitat. This relationship appears to have been overlooked in recent studies of various components of the soil water balance model, possibly due to limited and unreliable estimates of evapotranspiration (ET). An improved relationship between 'estimated' ET and measured dry matter production should improve the capability of the soil water balance model to predict deep drainage, which is primarily dependent on the ET. Ways to increase pasture productivity and soil water use include regular applications of fertilizer and lime, and better management of waterlogged and acidic soils in the HRZ. Summer-active native species may also be useful on soils where the persistence of other deep-rooted perennials is poor; however, little is known about their productivity and persistence when heavily grazed. We believe that the relationship between water use and pasture production needs to be reassessed to improve the predictability of the soil water balance approach and recommend further research in both the field and under controlled conditions to determine the potential for increased water use in the HRZ of southern Australia by combinations of plant species and greater pasture productivity. ### Countries mentioned: United Kingdom;Australia;United States ### Plant products search: lucerne;citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: drought stress;DM;human health;growing season;soil moisture;use efficiency;water deficit;dry matter;pest control;wide range ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2003,,Australian Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/AR02083,,#36447,,"",""
Monitoring changes in pastoral rangelands - the Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS).,"","Abstract: The Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS) consists of a set of ∼1620 permanent sites distributed across the pastoral rangelands of Western Australia used for commercial livestock grazing. The system is designed to provide information to government and the general community on changes in Western Australia's rangelands, rather than to individual landholders. It is designed to report at the regional or vegetation type level by selectively sampling representative areas of the rangelands, with representation occurring at several levels. The system was fully implemented by 1999 and all sites, except a small number of ongoing replacements, have now been re-assessed at least once. Two site types are used. In grassland areas, the frequency of all perennial species is assessed, and an estimate made of crown cover of woody perennials. In shrubland areas, a direct census technique is used, with the demography and maximum canopy dimensions of all shrubs recorded. Changes in soil surface condition and patch distribution are also assessed using standard Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) techniques. The vegetation and soil surface information is used to indicate rangeland change. The system is not fixed within any single model of range dynamics and the outputs of WARMS can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the specific requirements of the end-user. The paper includes discussion of the institutional requirements for WARMS, the site stratification and selection criteria, description of the field methods used and the rationale behind its design. It also considers the implications of the site stratification and selection criteria in terms of the caveats that need to accompany reporting. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: CAP;plant height;point view ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2007,,Rangeland Journal,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/RJ07008,,#37224,,"",""
Population and the pastoral economy in Mongolia.,"","Abstract: The central hypothesis discussed in the paper is that the main determinant of the subsistence of nomadic pastoralism in Mongolia has been the low population density existing in rural areas. The rapid urbanization experienced by the country after World War II prevented expansion of the rural labour force, which in turn resulted in limited population pressures on the vast grassland areas. As a result, intensification of livestock breeding activities conducive to sedentarization was not necessary. The paper examines the hypothesis, and discusses the possible impact on the pastoral economy of some of the economic transformation that Mongolia has been experiencing since the 1990 reform movement. The collapse of the urban industrial sector is resulting in an unexpected process of urban to rural migration. Rapid rural population growth may result in significant expansion of the livestock herds, which may endanger the fragile ecosystem of the Mongolian steppe and prevent sustained development of the pastoral economy. ### Countries mentioned: Mongolia ### Topics keywords: spatial distribution;population density;protected area;human activity;biological control;rural area ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1995,,"Working Papers in Demography, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University",,,,,,,#36463,,"",""
Possibilities for managing submarginal and loss making farms.,"","Abstract: A considerable proportion of USSR farms are in financial difficulties and can only keep their heads above water through considerable supplements to normal producer prices. Many farms are poorly organized and managed, the working and living conditions in the villages are poor. The farms themselves are not wholly to blame for this situation as they were without rights and forced into a central bureaucratic system. It follows that both the state and the farm management systems need to be changed. Even then some of the farms will not be viable and will have to be closed down. ### Topics keywords: living condition;animal welfare;rural household;rural area",1990,,Vestnik Sel'skokhozyaĭstvennoĭ Nauki (Moskva),,,,,,,#36204,,"",Experimental
Possible outcomes of small-scale user participation in water user associations in South Africa.,"","Abstract: The research analysed the transformation of 5 irrigation boards responsible for water management, and presently composed only of large-scale users, into more inclusive water user associations. The aim was to better understand the opportunities and the constraints with regard to the uplifting of small-scale users. It was found that large-scale farmers are ready to open the irrigation boards to small-scale users (e.g. small-scale farmers) whose activities impact on theirs, but not small-scale users with no impact (i.e. farm workers and rural communities). This move to wider involvement is constrained by the lack of overlap between current small-scale users' needs and the current core functions of the water user association.

Potentials and constraints of banana-based farming systems: a case of an upland village in West Java.,"","Abstract: Attempts were made to determine the potential of, and constraints on agricultural development for small farmers through an investigation of a participatory farming systems approach in a remote upland area in Indonesia. Sukamekar Village (Desa) in Cibinong District (Kecamatan) in Cianjur (Kabupaten) in West Java became our research site. The upland area in southern Cianjur had been selected as the target for the agricultural promotion project of the Ministry of Agriculture called P2RT and SPAKU. Banana was the ""superior"" commodity selected for promotion. Our baseline survey of 51 households in 1998 revealed that, on the average, a farmer operates 0.20 ha of lowland and 0.72 ha of upland, i.e. a total of 0.92 ha. The lowland absorbed roughly half of the labour input and rice was very important for household subsistence. Because of the project, the village road was improved to enable a better market access, and villagers began shipping out farm products to the markets in large cities. Upland crops in the area included banana, maize, groundnut, soyabean, cassava, and chili, among which banana and chili were the main cash earners. Tree crops such as clove and tree extracts such as palm sugar also contributed to the farmers' cash income. Yet, households that could earn a sizable income from agriculture only were a minority. Nonfarm income sources and remittances from family members were indispensable for a fair number of households. Farmer groups were organized and became an important vehicle for extension and subsidy distribution at first, and subsequently for further economic cooperation such as collective sales of farm products and purchase of fertilizers and chemicals. In addition to the difficulties associated with the remoteness and unfavourable soil and water conditions in the area, farmers had to cope with the rising input cost and depressed agricultural market. While individual farmers alone are too small, local farmer groups play a vital role in articulating the needs, interests, and ambitions of fellow farmers. Public attention and support are necessary not only for basic infrastructure improvement but also for organization and human resource development. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Indonesia ### Plant products search: clover;chili;chillies;soybeans;maize;cassava;rice;groundnuts;bananas;cloves ### Programs found: promotional project;promotion project ### Topics keywords: farming system;value chain;developing country;ministry agriculture;rural development;smallholder farmer;social capital;market access ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2002,,JIRCAS Working Report,,,,,,,#37210,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-20 20:02:46)(Screen): No mention of yields or farmer incomes.

"Land use impacts on nutrient export in the Central Volcanic Plateau, North Island.","","Abstract: Different land uses are increasingly being scrutinised for their impacts on downstream waterbodies, particularly in relation to rates of nutrient export. Phosphorus export varies mostly with sediment erosion but nitrogen export is mostly associated with nitrate leaching to groundwater, which is highly variable under different land uses. Both plantation and native forests leach a fraction of the nitrate of most pastoral lands except perhaps just after harvest, but particularly compared with modern farming regimes of addition of labile nitrogenous fertilisers to increase pasture growth and support higher stock numbers. Recent use of dating techniques to 'age' stream inflows to Lake Taupo and the Rotorua lakes suggest that the effects on stream nitrate concentrations of past conversions of forest to pastoral land and more recent intensification of pastoral land are only partially expressed, as stream inflows are mostly several decades old.

In spite of its arid characteristics, it was a densely populated area during the Pre-hispanic period. The populations developed an agropastoral economy, taking advantage of the wetter epochs that characterized some periods. The study of fluvio-aeolian records of the El Paso and Cafayate areas yielded interesting data for regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Geomorphological maps, field surveys, and archaeological digs were complemented with the detailed stratigraphic record of several points, together with radiocarbon and OSL dating. Alternating wetter and drier periods were inferred for the last 2,800 years. The wetter phases generated enough stability to allow soil formation and a better plant cover, thus favouring human settlements. For the paleoenvironmental interpretation, well defined European chronozones were used because there are no South American denominations. Within the sequence, some wetter periods stand out, such as the one between 2,800-2,500 BP, the intermediate Roman Period (80-280 AD), and the LALIA (Late Antique Little Ice Age) (536-660 AD), while the drier phases comprise the Roman Epoch and the Medieval Climate Anomaly. Moreover, dune active phases during the last millennium were determined for 1,000, 1,350, 1,650, and 1,770 AD approximately, separated by wetter periods recorded by the presence of a paleosoil (15th century) and historical data (17th and 18th centuries). ### Countries mentioned: Argentina;United States;Philippines ### Programs found: breeding program (BP) ### Topics keywords: protected area;human activity;anaerobic digestion ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2018,,Boletin Geologico y Minero,,,,,https://doi.org/10.21701/bolgeomin.129.4.004,,#36230,,"",""
"Low income farm households: incidence, characteristics and options for improving policy measures.","","Abstract: The incidence of low income amongst farmers in Ireland is examined. Particular attention is given to the farm and household characteristics of these farmers and the role of farm policy measures in alleviating their income problems. Data available from the CSO Household Budget Survey (1994/95) and from the Living in Ireland Survey (ESRI 1994) were used. The results show that a quarter of farm households had household incomes which were below the 60 percent poverty line. The households were widely spread throughout the country but there was some concentration in Connacht. Most of those in poverty were small-scale drystock farmers and a high proportion had children. Policy measures introduced in the interim, especially REPS and Farm Assist, are likely to have partly alleviated this low income problem. However, it is concluded that the risk of poverty still persisted for small-scale farmers who depended mainly on farming for their household income. ### Countries mentioned: Ireland ### Topics keywords: small scale;rural household;household income;extension service;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2004,,"Proceedings of the Agricultural Economics Society of Ireland, 1999-2000",,,,,,,#36234,,"",""

Performance evaluation of experimental self-propelled double row sugarcane harvester,"","Abstract: India produces more than 340 millions tones of cane at an average rate of 70 tons per ha. It is grown by small, medium and big farmers, but 83 % of sugarcane growers fall in small holder category. Sugarcane harvesting is the single most expensive and labour intensive operation in sugarcane farming. Whole Stalk harvesting or Cut-chop harvesting are expensive systems and as such beyond the capacity of average farmer of developing countries. Most of the sugarcane farmers in developing countries use a handheld knife to cut the sugarcane stalks at the base level and green top by impact force. In some developing countries, including India, farmers are beginning to face labour shortages, because of recurring labour scarcity during harvest season. It is desirable to transport the harvested cane to the factory within 24 h, as the yield declines by 0.4 % per day after cutting. In this study an experimental self-propelled double row sugarcane harvester powered by an 8 hp diesel engine was used. The machine was evaluated for field capacity (ha/h), fuel consumption (L/h) and material capacity (t/h) as dependent parameters and forward speed (2 level), method of collection (viz. guide bar method and rope method) and cutter bar speed (3 level) as the independent parameters. The experiment was conducted for trench planted sugarcane crop. The optimum parameters were found at; forward speeds 1.0-1.4 km/h, guide bar and 1020 strokes/min of knife bar in trench plant cane. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: sugarcane ### Measurements for interventions: sugarcane;sugarcane grower;cane ### Topics keywords: fuel consumption;experiment conducted;plant height;developing country;growing season;significant difference;drip irrigation;agricultural machinery;energy consumption;dry matter;flow rate ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,"AMA, Agricultural Mechanization in Asia, Africa and Latin America",,,,,,,#37562,,"",""
On the role of regional survey in administration and land planning.,"","Abstract: One of the first requirements of colonial regional survey is for a ""comprehensive field handbook that deals simply and clearly with all aspects of regional survey, so that any officer can, for example, read intelligently a geological or soil map, recognize and plot, in the course of his touring, the common types of rock that outcrop along the paths and rivers in his district, and assess their significance in the use of the land. A simple standard form of soil description is required. Vegetation types should be described, illustrated, and annotated so that they too may be correlated with other factors in land use. Outline studies of native economics should be included; notes on the assessment of population changes; a resume of agricultural and pastoral systems in a variety of regions, and suggested lines of enquiry and advancement; a more complete account than is yet available of forest policy and practice in regard both to the exploitation of resources and the maintenance of rural amenities; evidence of deterioration in rural conditions-a lowering of the water-table, laterization, decreasing yields, impoverished, pasture, irregularity in rainfall, emigration and so on."" An outline is given of a regional survey which it is stated could be carried out in West Africa with little more than the staff at present available.

"Patterns of timber harvesting and its relationship with sustainable forest management in the western Amazon, Ecuador case.","","Abstract: The Amazon rainforest lies within the most diverse forest ecosystem in the world. However, a large part of the tropical rainforest is being degraded because of timber harvesting without any sustainability criteria and owing to a limited understanding of the effects of forest exploitation. The Ecuadorian Amazon (EA) is part of the Andes Amazon (AA), an area covered by five countries (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia). This research identified the patterns of legal timber harvesting in the EA and determined current trends with respect to mostly harvested forest species. Two harvesting programs aimed at small farmers prevail in the EA: first, naturally regenerated trees felling program, and simplified timber harvesting programs in native forests. Considering the surface and volume of logging, significant differences were detected between logging procedures and ecosystems in the region. Two hundred and thirty-two genera are registered for harvest and, 51.93% of the total harvesting volume comes from eight genera and ten species. This research shows that in fallows of fragmented forest ecosystems, small farmers are harvesting fast-growing pioneer species. Maintaining a sustainable production in timber harvesting depends, by and large, on the harvesting and felling programs established on small farms. ### Countries mentioned: Colombia;Ecuador;Venezuela;Bolivia;Peru ### Programs found: timber harvesting program;tree felling program;felling program;harvesting program ### Topics keywords: ascorbic acid;chemical composition;amino acid;microbial community;significant difference;antioxidant activity;enzyme activity;RO;NF ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2017,,Journal of Sustainable Forestry,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10549811.2017.1308869,,#36857,,"",""
Peasant Survival Strategies in Ethiopia,"","Abstract: This paper focuses on peasant farmers in Ethiopia, and their behaviour as serious famine sets in. In many of the last seventeen years the crop yields on rain‐fed plots in drought‐prone areas have failed to meet the requirements of the peasant farmers and their families. Significant numbers have received food aid either at distribution points or in the shelters which developed in 1973 and 1984. Seeking food relief from external sources, however, is the last resort of peasants who have managed their dwindling resources for months, if not years, in order to survive. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: rural household;IPM;arable land ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1988,,Disasters,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7717.1988.tb00686.x,,#37505,,"",""
Nutrients for plants.,"","Abstract: Higher superphosphate rates used at establishment will help to produce a stable grass dominant pasture. Max. yields on sown pasture come from 250 kg superphosphate/ha at establishment followed by 250 kg superphosphate in the development period (usually 3 yr). At establishment, 500-750 kg superphosphate/ha followed by top dressings of 125 kg superphosphate/ha gives the max. yields in pasture sown on unfertilized 2 coarse granite soils that are poorly buffered. Old fertilized pastures grazed by sheep may decline in productivity because K and other nutrients are transferred to the sheep camp via dung and urine. Stocking rate largely determines the rate and quantity of P that cycles through the soil and the grazing animal. The application of superphosphate to pastures increases the population of invertebrate animals such as beetle larvae, springtails, earthworms and mites as well as the soil microbes. The soil microbes which include bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes and protozoa are important in the grazing system. Their corpses and excreta contribute large amounts of P to an organic P pool whence the P is taken up by the pasture plants. Increasing the turnover rate of these organisms could reduce the need for fertilizers, including superphosphate. Recently sown or well established sown pastures on soils with a low soil phosphate test should receive priority for superphosphate application. Red and black basaltic soils often respond to S alone, whereas sedimentary (""trap"") and granite soils require P and some S (as in superphosphate). In a grazing system, S, like P, is constantly cycling and recycling and stocking rate influences the rate of cycling. Finely ground S is more readily available to plants. Excessive S in pastures can cause Se and Cu deficiencies in livestock. The ""Decide"" model [described] can interrelate and quantify many of the variables which affect the ever changing grazing scene. It predicts opt. economic superphosphate rates as well as providing information for other management decisions. ### Measurements for interventions: phosphate;pasture ### Topics keywords: DM;stocking rate;dairy farm;beef cattle",1979,,"Pastoral Research on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales.",,,,,,,#36244,,"",""
Offsetting legal deficits of native vegetation among Brazilian landholders: effects on nature protection and socioeconomic development.,"","Abstract: The Brazilian native vegetation supports essential ecosystem services and biodiversity for the global society, while land use competition may intensify around the increasing needs for food, fibre and bioenergy. The Brazilian Forest Act of 2012 amplified a market-based mechanism for offsetting native vegetation deficits in private farmlands. This mechanism enables a large-scale trading system allowing landholders to offset their own deficits of native vegetation by purchasing certificates associated with a surplus of native vegetation from other landholders. This mechanism is an alternative for the more expensive restoration of native vegetation on own land. The launching of the mechanism now depends on specific regulations at state level, which may include geographical restrictions for offsetting deficits. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects in nature protection and socio-economic development of different offsetting implementation alternatives. Our findings suggest that in a business-as-usual scenario the offsetting mechanism may have little or no additional effects on protection of native vegetation, because most of the offsetting is likely to take place where native vegetation is already protected by prevailing legislations. We concluded that it is possible to maximise environmental and socio-economic returns from the offsetting mechanism without undermining productive land. This would be possible if regulations ensure additionality in nature protection while enabling a self-sustaining mechanism for income generation for small-scale family farmers in the poorest region of Brazil, protecting biodiversity and counteracting major trade-offs between ecosystem services. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Topics keywords: small scale;trade offs;ecosystem service;environmental impact;land use;crop residue;large scale ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,Land Use Policy,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.014,,#37647,,"",""

Onion weed - good management can help.,"","Abstract: In South Australia, onion weed (Asphodelus fistulosus) occurs mainly in areas with an average annual rainfall of 200-375 mm, and particularly on sandy soils, though dense infestations occur also in the low rainfall pastoral country. The botany of A. fistulosus is described and recommendations are given for its cultural and chemical control. Heavily infested areas on Mallee-type soils suitable for cropping should be cultivated dry during January-March and sown to cereals the first year, cereals or lucerne the second year and annual medicks the third year. Paraquat may be used as an aid to control A. fistulosus in legume pastures where the weed is sufficiently dense badly to affect crop vigour and production. Legumes should be sprayed no earlier than the 4-trifoliate-leaf stage and stock should be withheld from the sprayed area for 21 days. Picloram + 2,4-D + diquat or repeat applications of paraquat are recommended for the control of A. fistulosus on non-cropped sites. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Plant products search: onions;cereals;lucerne ### Topics keywords: DM;plant height;water saving ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1973,,"Journal of Agriculture, South Australia",,,,,,,#37624,,"",""
Pastures and landscape conservation.,"","Abstract: A report of studies from 1960 to 1982 at Tagel, in Kronobergs Län, S. Sweden, (now a foundation for agricultural and forestry research), on the merits of keeping 'marginal land' open by pastoral use. It is estimated that it would cost about 2000 kr/ha to do so (these are the losses incurred in cattle raising or sheep farming). Mechanical mowing and brush cutting would be the cheapest (apart from doing nothing and allowing natural invasion of woody species). Financially, growing spruce would be the best solution and would produce positive soil values. Some pasture use is considered desirable from the point of view of landscape and nature conservation. If intangibles such as amenity value, recreation, historical continuity, employment, and (more speculatively) avoidance of increasing the effects of acid rain are set against the financial losses, the best solution might be a slightly pastured open woodland without fertilizer treatment. ### Countries mentioned: Sweden ### Topics keywords: protected area;specie richness;point view ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1984,,"Rapport, Avdelningen för Landskapsvǻrd, Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet",,,,,,,#36672,,"",""
"Patterns of seed softening in subterranean clover in a cool, temperate environment.","","Abstract: The effect of genotype and of growing and softening environments on the short-term loss of dormancy in subterranean clover during the summer and early autumn was investigated. Burrs of six cultivars and one accession of subterranean clover that varied widely in maturity and hardseed level were placed to soften on the soil surface, over the summer-autumn period, under two contrasting environments in western Victoria, Australia: Hamilton and Telopea Downs. There were significant differences (&lt;0.05) in the rate of hardseed breakdown both among cultivars and at the two locations. At the cooler site, Hamilton, the levels of residual hardseed after the summer averaged 75% (over all cultivars and growing sites), compared with 66% at Telopea Downs. There was no interaction between cultivar and location of softening. At the end of the period of field exposure the ranking from lowest to highest residual hardseed was cv. Enfield &lt; Leura = Gosse &lt; Dalkeith &lt; York = SE008 = Nungarin. High levels of embryo dormancy in Leura indicate that this cultivar has the capacity for delayed germination via embryo dormancy. It is suggested that in cool temperate environments high seed banks of subterranean clover can be achieved due to a lower percentage of seed softening, which in turn means a potentially greater long-term persistence of subterranean clover and the possibility of conducting 1:1 pasture-crop rotations in a rainfall zone where consistently high grain yields may be expected. ### Countries mentioned: Australia;United States;United Kingdom ### Plant products search: cloves;grain;clover ### Topics keywords: short term;crop rotation;grain yield;significant difference;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1999,,Agronomy Journal,,,,,,,#37178,,"",""
"Perception of climate change and its impact by smallholders in pastoral/agropastoral systems of Borana, South Ethiopia","","Abstract: This study investigates the perception of historic changes in climate and associated impact on local agriculture among smallholders in pastoral/agropastoral systems of Borana in southern Ethiopia. We drew on empirical data obtained from farm household surveys conducted in 5 districts, 20 pastoral/agropastoral associations and 480 farm households. Using this data, this study analyses smallholders’ perception of climate change and its associated impact on local agriculture, and the effect of various household and farm attributes on perception. Results suggest that most participants perceived climatic change and its negative impact on agricultural and considered climate change as a salient risk to their future livelihoods and economic development. Different levels of perception were expressed in terms of climate change and the impact on traditional rain-fed agriculture. Age, education level, livestock holding, access to climate information and extension services significantly affected perception levels. Household size, production system, farm and non-farm incomes did not significantly affect perception levels of smallholders. Smallholders attributed climate change to a range of biophysical, deistic and anthropogenic causes. Increased access to agricultural support services, which improves the availability and the quality of relevant climate information will further enhance awareness of climate change within of the rural community and result in better management of climate-induced risks in these vulnerable agricultural systems. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;CC;rural community;rural household;environmental impact;survey conducted;negative impact;climatic change;extension service;household survey;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2015,,SpringerPlus,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-015-1012-9,,#37352,,"",""
Performance of denitrifying bioreactors at reducing agricultural nitrogen pollution in a humid subtropical coastal plain climate,"","Abstract: Denitrifying bioreactors are an agricultural best management practice developed in the midwestern United States to treat agricultural drainage water enriched with nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N). The practice is spreading rapidly to agricultural regions with poor water quality due to nutrient enrichment. This makes it imperative to track bioreactor NO 3 -N reduction efficiency as this practice gets deployed to new regions. This study evaluated the application and performance of denitrifying bioreactors in the humid subtropical coastal plain environment of the Chesapeake Bay catchment to provide data about regionally specific NO 3 -N reduction efficiencies. NO 3 -N samples were taken before and after treatment at three denitrifying bioreactors, in addition to other nutrients (orthophosphate-phosphorus, PO 4 -P; ammonium-nitrogen, NH 4 -N; total nitrogen, TN; total phosphorus, TP) and water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, DO; oxidation reduction potential, ORP; pH; specific conductance, SPC). Total removal ranged drastically between bioreactors from 10 to 133 kg N, with removal efficiencies of 9.0% to 62% and N removal rates of 0.21 to 5.36 g N removed per m 3 of bioreactor per day. As the first bioreactor study in the humid subtropical coastal plain, this data provides positive proof of concept that denitrifying bioreactor is another tool for reducing N loads in agricultural tile drainage in this region. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Programs found: operational research program (ORP);opium replacement program (ORP) ### Measurements for interventions: bioreactors ### Topics keywords: tillage practice;bulk density;TN;wastewater treatment;NH4;BMP;removal efficiency;rice straw;NO3;flow rate;total phosphorus;NT;total porosity;VI;TP;management practice;WWTP;COD;best management practice ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Water (Switzerland),,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/w9020112,,#37188,,"",""
Physical planning of agricultural areas with outdated structures.,"","Abstract: Two types of factors influencing the structure of an agricultural area are distinguished: (1) external, including the situation of cities and industries, main highways, waterways and recreation areas, and (2) internal, e.g. the number and characteristics of village-areas, farm structure, road and drainage system, field pattern and recreational sites within the total area. Based on data of the amelioration area of De Dongeradelen, an economic valuation of these factors is given. It was found that the rapid increase in wages widens the land/man ratio, resulting in heavy demands for larger holdings. The disparity between agricultural and industrial wages also increases, but incomes from larger holdings compare more favourably than those from small farms. Though the number of small farms is continuing to diminish, the natural rate of disappearance is too slow. All over Europe efforts are therefore being made to speed up this natural process by buying up land, pensioning off the farmers, training people employed in agriculture for other professions, and large-scale integral improvement plans. Thus uniform data and relevant maps are essential. H.

Producer insurance and risk management options for smallholder farmers,"","Abstract: Many smallholder families are exceptionally prone to potentially catastrophic decreases in their incomes and access to food. Over the past decade, therefore, policy makers and economists have increasingly focused on potential mechanisms for expanding risk management strategies available to those families. Commercially provided weather-based index insurance products, perhaps partially funded by subsidies, have been of particular interest because of their apparent potential to provide payments to smallholder families when they are most in need of help. However, the empirical evidence from a wide range of studies indicates that, absent relatively substantial subsidies, small holder farmers will not purchase commercially priced index products or even ""all risk"" products where payments are tied to the farm's crop losses. There are three important reasons why this is the case. First, smallholder farmers already have many ways of managing their risks, including informal community-based initiatives, on-farm production decisions and off-farm work. Second, index insurance schemes are subject to considerable basis risk; families often do not receive an index insurance indemnity when they experience a substantial crop loss on their farms. Third, the fixed costs of delivering crop insurance to smallholders make such coverage expensive. The potential market for weather index insurance therefore may be limited to insuring relatively large groups of farmers, either directly or indirectly though providing micro finance and other lending institution with coverage against widespread loan defaults associated with catastrophic events like major droughts. Alternatively, weather indexes could simply be used to more accurately target emergency aid. Index insurance, Risk management, Food insecurity, Basis risk.

Promoting sustainable capital-led intensification in Sahel agriculture following macroeconomic policy reform,"","Abstract: Rapid, sustainable intensification is needed in Sahel agriculture. In both favorable and unfavorable agroclimatic zones, intensification is already proceeding as population density increases and extensification options disappear. The first key issue is what kind of intensification can meet pressing needs for agricultural products yet be environmentally sustainable? We contend that ""capital-led intensification"" is the best option to meet this dual need. This path involves significantly increased use of chemical fertilizer, manure, bunds, and animal traction. (We illustrate from the cotton zones of Mali and Burkina Faso.) Capital-deficient intensification is unfortunately more common, involving merely an increase in labor per hectare and a reduction in fallowing. Moreover, where capital is used it is often ""partial capital-led intensification"" which is unsustainable. We illustrate with the case of peanuts in Senegal, where seeding density has been increased without accompanying rue of fertilizers to prefect soil fertility This exhausts the soil and leads to lower yields and incomes, and a vicious circle of more capital-deficient intensification or even extensification onto fragile marginal lands. (We illustrate from the Peanut Basin of Senegal.) Hence, low-capital agriculture or intensification with key missing capital inputs is not sustainable under conditions of high population pressure. The second key issue is how to replace the public credit, input supply, and extension systems that were eliminated in the 1980s. Although these systems had high budgetary costs, their elimination sharply increased input costs to farmers and led to a decline in input use. Public or private alternatives to these systems are not yet in place. The main task ahead is to overcome structural constraints to capital investment, and specifically to: I) redesign and reintroduce agricultural support programs; 2) tackle the taboo subject of subsidies to fertilizer and soil conservation investments; 3) remove bottlenecks to private investments by making complementary public investments, e.g, in roads, trucks to haul laterite for bunds, culverts to protect farmland wells to water windbreaks, etc.,. 4) promote smallholder cash cropping in vertically integrated systems that reduce risk and provide inputs, credit and attractive prices, and 5) link nonfarm enterprise and employment programs to farm investment goals, especially where spinoffs from agriculture are possible. An illustration is the manufacture and repair of animal traction equipment. ### Countries mentioned: Senegal;Mali;Burkina Faso ### Plant products search: cotton;peanuts ### Programs found: support program;agricultural support program;employment program ### Topics keywords: sustainable intensification;spatial distribution;chemical fertilizer;DM;CA;soil fertility;biological control;CF;population density;protected area;human activity;contract farming;smallholder farmer;farming system;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1997,,FOOD SECURITY AND INNOVATIONS: SUCCESSES AND LESSONS LEARNED,,,,,,,#36833,,"",""

Land-use, abiotic, and sward variables were also recorded. Change in meadow extent was estimated by comparing a digital map of open meadows with a cadastral map with 1950s provenance. We found: A decrease in open area, mostly attributable to reduction in grazing meadows. 75 or more butterfly species with species richness principally, and positively, influenced by altitude and presence of scrub in the body of the meadow. Hay meadow management was a positive influence on richness of satyrids. When all butterflies were considered together, the only significant factor influencing abundance was (-ve). For sub-groups of the butterfly community there was no consistent pattern, although was identified as a (-ve) factor in relation to hesperiid, nymphalid, satyrid, and -feeding fritillary groups. Several regression models included components that could be linked to abiotic influences (water, aspect, altitude) but many were indicative of abandonment or relaxation of management intensity (scrub, , ), sward components, fragmentation (distance to nearest meadow, number of meadows within 100 m), and land use (hay management, summer grazing). The results are discussed in relation to changing socio-economics, including the potential impact of tourism, and the need for financial instruments to support extensive farming. ### Countries mentioned: Spain ### Topics keywords: land use;specie richness;factor influencing ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Journal of Insect Conservation,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10841-010-9331-1,,#37016,,"",""
Rangeland tenure and pastoralism in Africa.,"","Abstract: The chapter is concerned with the transformation in pastoral land tenure taking place across Africa. The linkages between pastoralism, dryland agriculture and the customary forms of land tenure in Africa are examined. The general trends of increasing pressure on the rangeland resources, growing privatization of arid lands and decreasing security of tenure for pastoralists are explained and analysed. The situation of East African herders, focusing on the dynamics of changes in property forms among Maasai communities in Kenya and Tanzania and forms of local dispossession they are experiencing, is reviewed. Three general trends in rangeland occupation and tenure are observed: an increasing and more heterogenous population; diminishing security of pasture tenure; and a greater occurrence and severity of conflict over resource tenure and use. It is in the context of increasing pressure that changes in rangeland tenure have and are occurring toward individualization, privatization and greater control by the state. Bureaucratic management has proven relatively inefficient; examples cited are the failure of heavily supported state ranches in several East African countries. This experience has led to a reversal, a virtual counter-revolution in development policy, which, under the assumption that individual and exclusive ownership of land would lead to greater efficiency in production, came to advocate privatization not only of state but also of common property. The establishment of group and individual ranches is discussed, as is their subsequent subdivision. The failure of group ranches is blamed on the lack of a definite membership representative of a defined community, although that was their original mandate. If current trends continue, the rangelands may be partitioned increasingly into individual and state holdings, the former making use of patchy resources, the latter securing extensive plains for wildlife preservation and tourism. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Tanzania ### Topics keywords: protected area;land tenure;land reform;land degradation ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1994,,African pastoralist systems: an integrated approach.,,,,,,,#36812,,"",""
A regional assessment of the cost and effectiveness of mitigation measures for reducing nutrient losses to water and greenhouse gas emissions to air from pastoral farms.,"","Abstract: Using a novel approach that links geospatial land resource information with individual farm-scale simulation, we conducted a regional assessment of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) losses to water and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to air from the predominant mix of pastoral industries in Southland, New Zealand. An evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of several nutrient loss mitigation strategies applied at the farm-scale, set primarily for reducing N and P losses and grouped by capital cost and potential ease of adoption, followed an initial baseline assessment. Grouped nutrient loss mitigation strategies were applied on an additive basis on the assumption of full adoption, and were broadly identified as 'improved nutrient management' (M1), 'improved animal productivity' (M2), and 'restricted grazing' (M3). Estimated annual nitrate-N leaching losses occurring under representative baseline sheep and beef (cattle) farms, and representative baseline dairy farms for the region were 10±2 and 32±6 kg N/ha (mean±standard deviation), respectively. Both sheep and beef and dairy farms were responsive to N leaching loss mitigation strategies in M1, at a low cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Only dairy farms were responsive to N leaching loss abatement from adopting M2, at no additional cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Dairy farms were also responsive to N leaching loss abatement from adopting M3, but this reduction came at a greater cost per kg N-loss mitigated. Only dairy farms were responsive to P-loss mitigation strategies, in particular by adopting M1. Only dairy farms were responsive to GHG abatement; greater abatement was achieved by the most intensified dairy farm system simulated. Overall, M1 provided for high levels of regional scale N- and P-loss abatement at a low cost per farm without affecting overall farm production, M2 provided additional N-loss abatement but only marginal P-loss abatement, whereas M3 provided the greatest N-loss abatement, but delivered no additional P abatement, and came at a large financial cost to farmers, sheep and beef farmers in particular. The modelling approach provides a farm-scale framework that can be extended to other regions to accommodate different farm production systems and performances, capturing the interactions between farm types, land use capabilities and production levels, as these influence nutrient losses and GHG emissions, and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Animal products search: beef ### Measurements for crops: beef ### Measurements for interventions: N leaching loss ### Topics keywords: GHG emission;environmental impact;land use;NH4;N2O;dairy farm;CH4;NO3;greenhouse gas;beef cattle;greenhouse gas emission;GHG ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.03.041,,#37402,,"",""
How much runoff do riparian wetlands affect?,"","Abstract: Nitrate runoff from pastoral farming is of concern because it contributes to lake eutrophication. Surface flow in wetlands is a measure of the runoff likely to experience nitrate attenuation. This study assessed the potential of small headwater wetlands to reduce catchment nitrate loads by quantifying the proportion of total runoff that occurred as surface flow at the outlet of wetlands. Surface flow can be measured from wetlands in side valleys (valley wetlands) with well defined flow channels, but not in those parallel to the stream (riparian wetlands) with distributed flow. This study, from November 2004 to June 2008: (1) measured the mean specific flow yield (mm yr-1) at the outlet of 6 wetlands; (2) classified wetlands into 3 types based on hydrology; (3) mapped and classified all wetlands in the catchment; and (4) calculated the area-weighted mean specific yield of wetlands for the whole catchment. The 6.6 km2 study catchment at Taupo, North Island, New Zealand, was predominantly pasture on volcanic soils where flows were baseflow dominated. Riparian and valley wetlands occupied 5% of catchment area. Type 1 wetlands flowed continuously, were dominated by baseflow (81-83%), and had a mean annual yield (±SE) of 167±46 mm (34% of stream yield). Type 2 wetlands dried up during droughts and type 3 wetlands dried up each summer. Both latter types had a low baseflow component (20%) and a yield of 66±18 mm (13% of stream yield). In one tributary, gaugings over 4 days in summer during a wet year indicated that 27% of streamflow originated from wetlands. For the catchment as a whole, wetland baseflow accounted for 11±4% of mean annual streamflow and wetland quickflow another 8±2%, although these percentages are likely underestimates because seepages occurred downslope from measurement points. Although riparian and valley wetlands occupied only 5% of the catchment area, they could potentially have attenuated nitrogen in 11-19% of runoff. Other catchments may have different hydrology and wetland nitrate attenuation, and the methods outlined here could be used to quantify these differences. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Measurements for interventions: nitrogen ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;DOC;NO3 ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research,,,,,,,#37564,,"",""
Post-harvest problems in the tropics.,"","Abstract: This review of the effects of ""external"" and ""internal"" agencies on specific commodities considers the problems of storage and those of processing under separate headings, while recognizing that they are closely interrelated. It is concluded that whilst considerable improvements have been achieved by new technologies and new approaches to storage and processing at the small farmer and at the commercial level, there is still a sad lack of awareness of the need to ensure that a primary product is suitable for its proposed end-use. Whilst successful plant breeding programmes against insect pests and disease for increasing yield and nutritional content are widespread, there has been little if any effort made to breed and select for post-harvest properties. The quality of field produce is determined initially by factors such as varietal characteristics, fertilizer and water regimes, growing season and time of harvest and all associated operations concerned with pest and disease control. This quality more than any other single factor determines the pattern and degree of all subsequent losses. Low quality means low suitability and acceptability for consumption, storage or processing, and high susceptibility to the whole range of destructive agencies leading to spoilage and wastage. Agricultural research and production, handling, storage, processing and marketing can be considered as a single system in which the individual elements are inter-reactive. There is a real need to relate agricultural research and production to end-use on the market. ### Programs found: breeding program (BP);plant breeding program (BP) ### Topics keywords: post harvest;insect pest;growing season;chemical composition",1984,,"Advancing agricultural production in Africa.

Physical accessibility and its role in landscape development—three historical analyses from South Slovakia,"","Abstract: Physical accessibility is recognised as an important driver or factor affecting landscape development in an increasing number of studies. This work uses cost-distance methods for analysis of landscape accessibility, and presents the analysis in three historical time periods focused on the effect of accessibility on landscape development in South Slovakia. First, from periods when the cultural landscape was forming, the effect of landscape accessibility on the location of settlements is given. The variables explaining the location of historical settlements are: slope steepness, accessibility to water expressed by distance to fluvial sediments and distance within 500 m from suitable soils for agriculture. The second example is from the second half of the twentieth century, when the small-scale agricultural landscape was transformed into large-scale fields suitable for industrial agriculture. Agricultural fields located on steeper slopes and closer to settlements were more likely to survive the collectivisation of agriculture. The third example shows accessibility as a factor affecting the abandonment of the remaining traditional agricultural landscapes (TAL) as a consequence of the economic and cultural changes triggered by the transition to an open market economy. The TAL located on less accessible areas are more likely affected by the abandonment. ### Countries mentioned: Slovakia ### Topics keywords: small scale;factor affecting;large scale ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Landscape Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/01426397.2016.1267336,,#37208,,"",""

Foreign skills and technical assistance in Greek development.,"","Abstract: The report appraises the whole contribution of technical assistance to Greece after World War II, covering high-level foreign advisers on policy and programmes, foreign technical assistance in all fields and assistance with training programmes, both practical courses and academic scholarship. The nature of the Greek economy is briefly reviewed as well as changes in employment and productivity that have occurred between 1951-61, the stock of Greek skills and their utilization, and the education and training available at home and abroad. It is shown that although agriculture produced a 59 per cent. increase in food supplies between 1950 and 1964, accompanied by substantial increases in cultivated areas, irrigation, use of fertilizers, etc., the sector has many basic weaknesses. Holdings are small and fragmented. The irrigated area is still small, fertilizer use is low, transport and markets are defective and farmers have poor technical training. A move away from subsidized wheat production towards high-quality export products like fresh fruits, cotton, vegetables and processed foods is desirable and there should be an expansion in livestock, forestry and fishing. Total technical assistance to agriculture amounted to $4.7 million between 1947 and 1963, mostly financed by foreign aid. Of this about $3 million was spent on 157 experts, 5780, 000 on 165 students, and $1 million on 775 trainees. Generally technical assistance has been a valuable but quantitatively minor supplement to the total stock of skills in Greece and there is little evidence of waste or duplication in the way it has been employed. Together with capital assistance, technical assistance has helped to produce a high rate of growth with price stability and balance of payments equilibrium. J.

Grassland farming and water quality in New Zealand.,"","Abstract: Pastoral agriculture is the dominant land use in New Zealand and accounted for 49% of merchanised export earnings in 2007. Agriculture has intensified in the last 20 years, with dairy expanding at the expense of sheep and beef farming. Although water quality in New Zealand is relatively good compared with Europe, North America and Asia, many lowland agricultural streams and rivers do not meet guideline values for contact recreational activities (e.g., swimming and water-sports) and the proportion of pastoral land cover with catchments has also been associated with trends in river and lake degradation. Agricultural pressures and aquatic impacts vary widely across New Zealand with farm systems and practices, natural factors that control contaminant delivery pathways (climate, landform, soils and geology), and receiving water characteristics/sensitivities (e.g., lakes vs streams vs groundwaters). Conflicts have been greatest where intensive farming occurs or was expected to expand in catchments with nutrient sensitive lakes or spring-fed streams. In the case of the iconic Lake Taupo catchment, this has recently resulted in a cap and trade scheme for nitrogen discharge from pastoral farming. Legislative management of the environmental impacts of agriculture on water quality has been largely controlled by 16 Regional Councils who can develop rules in Regional Plans and issue consents for activities through the Resource Management Act 1991. The dairy industry has been proactive in promoting improved environmental practice on farms. For example, the main dairy company, Fonterra Cooperative Ltd, has committed its farmers to the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, which requires several core practice improvements (involving nutrient management, effluent management, exclusion of cows from streams, and provision of bridges/culverts at regularly used stream crossings) by 2012. Agricultural and water researchers are working with industry to develop a toolbox of mitigation measures to control agricultural impacts on water values. Application of these tools to catchments with sheep and beef, deer or dairy farms has shown water quality benefits. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Animal products search: beef ### Topics keywords: land cover;environmental impact;land use;dairy industry;dairy farm ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,Tearmann,,,,,,,#37131,,"",""
Increase of drought stress negatively affects the sustainability of extensive sheep farming in sub-Mediterranean climate.,"","Abstract: The sub-Mediterranean climate, characterized by inter-annual variability, is undergoing an increase in aridity. We assessed how inter-annual variation of precipitation affects pastoral systems of central Italy, to evaluate whether climate change may cause extensive sheep farming to become unsustainable. Since the assessment of pasture-rumen interaction is considered a key tool in evaluating the status of the system, we collected data on precipitation, soil water deficit, aboveground phytomass, forage chemical composition, sheep rumen keratinization and body condition. We found that drought stress negatively affected forage quantity and quality with a pattern of responses that are partially different from those reported for both Mediterranean and Temperate regions. The most negatively affected plant communities were those of productive habitats. In clipped plots, we also observed a decrease in the re-growth capacity after clipping, especially in plant communities of southerly slopes. Positive correlations were identified for body condition with phytomass and crude protein, and negative correlations for rumen degree of keratinization with crude fibre and Acid Detergent Fibre. We suggested that the body condition of sheep deteriorates because the reduced quantity and quality of pasture changes the sheep rumen, which in turn limits absorption of volatile fatty acid. ### Countries mentioned: Italy ### Topics keywords: chemical composition;drought stress;use efficiency;essential oil;dry matter;water deficit;contract farming;VFA;chemical fertilizer;CF;anaerobic digestion;DM;CP;fatty acid;cover crop;climate change;volatile fatty acid;crude protein;soil moisture;CC ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2016,,Journal of Arid Environments,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.01.006,,#36510,,"",""
New tools for agriculture: the rainfall and agrometeorology project.,"","Abstract: Techniques adopted in Israel could be useful to the agriculture of the Italian Mezzogiorno. Many factors make the Mezzogiorno difficult for agriculture: land quality, small farms, lack of capital and education, little technology, but the overriding factor is lack of water due to unreliable rainfall. Israel has succeeded in devising a systematic annual stimulation of rain. Puglia and Sicily have agreed to a 'Project Rain' to see if the technology can be applied there. So far there has been little success but this is possibly due to scarcity of data, and attempts continue. Israel's experience suggests that neighbouring countries do not suffer, but in fact benefit also from more rainfall.

Olive production in Greece.,"","Abstract: Various aspects of olive production are discussed. Greece is the third largest olive producing country in the world (after Spain and Italy), with about 90 per cent, of its olive crop being utilized for oil production. Olive production (oil and table olive) amounts to about 12.5 per cent. of the gross value of the total production of all crops. Yields per tree are rather low, averaging about 12.5 kg. Olive growing is essentially a small-farm family enterprise cultivating an average of 1.6 ha. The common propagation methods of budding olive seedlings to the desired variety, or growing suckers for 1 to 2 years in the nursery and then budding them, require several years to establish the olive grove. Propagation by rooting leafy cuttings under water mist spray is a new method being applied in the country. T.

Pastoralist education in Kenya: continuity in exclusion in arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL).,"","Abstract: This paper documents the continuing educational challenges for nomadic pastoralists in Kenya, focusing mainly on primary education. Firstly, the paper provides an historical overview of government policies and programmes for pastoral people's education in the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) of Kenya and their implications for access to basic education. Secondly, it analyses the current policies on pastoralists' education in ASAL regions in light of the major socio-political and educational reforms taking place in the country. Lastly, the paper presents findings by UWEZO (an educational research and advocacy non-profit agency) on learning outcomes in ASAL regions where the pastoralists' children attend primary schools. The UWEZO 2012 data shows that although access to education in aggregate may have improved nationally, areas occupied by pastoralists still lag behind in student enrolment, student and teacher attendance, teaching and learning resources as well as achievement in reading and numeracy skills and performance in national examinations. A two-pronged approach to enhancing education for the nomadic pastoralist regions is suggested, consisting of policies to ensure 100% enrolment and strategies that will enhance retention and learning outcomes commensurate with each stage of education. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Programs found: policy program;government policy program ### Topics keywords: contract farming;food insecurity;factor influencing ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2015,,Journal of Third World Studies,,,,,,,#37622,,"",""
Mobilizing peasants for irrigation development.,"","Abstract: This paper discusses the apparent unwillingness of peasants to co-operate with new technology packages, and uses the Angat River Irrigation Scheme in the Philippines as an example. This is because plans for development usually lack incentives to elicit peasants' support or mobilize their latent capacities to participate actively in various programmes at the farm level. Cultivators play a more active part in traditional minor irrigation schemes. Three important requirements for further irrigation development are set out (1) A vertical communication channel between cultivators and administrators must be adopted, especially for feedback to policy makers regarding field problems; (2) Cultivators must be completely settled in the community - the Central Luzan example shows that temporary residents lack attachment to the land they cultivate; (3) agrarian reform and rural industrialization must be carried out. ### Countries mentioned: Philippines ### Topics keywords: small scale;natural resource;land reform;water saving;willingness pay;agrarian reform;decision making;contract farming;irrigation scheme;policy maker ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1977,,Farm water management for rice cultivation.,,,,,,,#37460,,"",""
Greek economic crisis and new agrarian dynamics: The example of Eastern Thessaly [Crise économique grecque et nouvelles dynamiques agraires: L’exemple de la Thessalie orientale],"","Abstract: Eastern Thessaly is a plain bordered by semi-mountainous landscape. The region is home to dairy sheep and goat farming systems exploiting both public and private agro-pastoral resources. The effect of decoupled payments, decreasing prices for irrigated cotton and groundwater depletion bring back complementarities between semi-mountainous breeding systems and plain-located productions (fodder crops). In parallel, the high unemployment rate and the decreasing incomes caused by Greek crisis are leading to conversion of activity in dairy sheep and goat farming, based on communal rangeland grazing. This farming activity is often characterized by a semi-subsistence economy with low cost, fully or partially exploring common spaces. Those two evolutions are promising because their combination in the same agrarian system could lead to complementarities in spatial management in favor of the development of small-ruminant farming systems. However, they face many limits to their development: current irrigated cropping systems are highly dependent on historically based decoupled payments, which represent more than 65% of their farming income. On the contrary, reconversion breeding systems based on rangeland utilization suffer from scant support from European subsidies, and yield low reproductive and productive parameters due to a lack of production means and technical information. Uncertain orientations of the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and economic situation in Greece will not allow the current farm income support to be maintained, nor the support for rural development. We must therefore guide agricultural development towards decreasing production costs and enhancing product value, through farming practices adapted to local fodder crops and development of local production networks. This article aims at showing how economic crisis and long-term European subsidies have shaped the agrarian system of Eastern Thessaly, and seeks to identify specific needs of regional dairy sheep breeding systems. ### Countries mentioned: Greece;Congo;France ### Plant products search: cotton ### Programs found: coordinated agricultural project (CAP);central arizona project (CAP);caribbean amblyomma program (CAP);conservation agriculture (CA) program ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;organic farming;CAP;small ruminant;cropping system;land degradation;farming practice;rural development;management practice;animal health;farming system;sustainable agriculture;long term ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Annales de Geographie,,,,,,,#36914,,"",""

Egyptian land reclamation since the Revolution ( agrarian reform).,"","Abstract: Since the Agrarian Reform Law of 1952 it has been clear that land redistribution is only a temporary and partial solution to the problem of the landless peasant. In agricultural production, moreover, results have been disappointing. Yet the Egyptian leadership has made an ideological commitment too great for the programme to be judged simply in terms of alternative means of achieving stated goals. Egyptian land reclamation has gone through a number of phases, both in policy and implementation. It has been more successful in reclaiming land on the fringes of the Delta than in desert and coastal areas which depend on groundwater and rainfall. A major problem has been the lack of co-ordination between the reclamation and subsequenct cultivation stages, but the principal obstacle has been the high and increasing cost of reclamation. -B.W.Beeley ### Countries mentioned: Canada;Egypt ### Topics keywords: arable land;land reform;cultivated land;land redistribution;agrarian reform;land reclamation ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1980,,Middle East Journal,,,,,,,#36599,,"",""
Green jobs: Working for people and the environment,"","Abstract: The pursuit of so-called ""green jobs"" - employment that contributes to protecting the environment and reducing humanity's carbon foot-print - will be a key economic driver of the 21st century. ""Climate-proofing"" the global economy will involve large-scale investments in new technologies, equipment, buildings, and infrastructure, which will provide a major stimulus for much-needed new employment and an opportunity for retaining and transforming existing jobs. The number of green jobs is on the rise. The renewable energy sector has seen rapid expansion in recent years, with current employment in renewables and supplier industries estimated at a conservative 2.3 million worldwide. The wind power industry employs some 300,000 people, the solar photovoltaics (PV) sector an estimated 170,000, and the solar thermal industry more than 600,000. More than I million jobs are found in the biofuels industry growing and processing a variety of feedstocks into ethanol and biodiesel. Construction jobs can be greened by ensuring that new buildings meet high performance standards. And retrofitting existing buildings to make them more energy-efficient has huge job potential for construction workers, architects, energy auditors, engineers, and others. The weatherization of some 200,000 apartments in Germany created 25,000 new jobs and helped retain 116,000 existing jobs in 2002-04. The transportation industry is a cornerstone of modern economics, but it also has the fastest-rising carbon emissions of any sector. Relatively green auto manufacturing jobs - those in manufacturing the most-efficient cars currently available - today number no more than about 250,000 out of roughly 8 million in the auto sector worldwide. Modern rail and urban transit systems offer a greener alternative, but they need fresh commitment and investments to reverse the job erosion of recent decades. In growing numbers of cities, good jobs are being generated by the emergence of bus rapid transit systems. There are also substantial green employment opportunities in retrofitting old diesel buses to reduce air pollutants and in replacing old equipment with cleaner compressed natural gas (CNG) or hybrid-electric buses. In New Delhi, the introduction of 6,100 CNG buses by 2009 is expected to create 18,000 new jobs. The steel, aluminum, cement, and paper industries are highly energy-intensive and polluting. But increasing scrap use, greater energy efficiency, and reliance on alternative energy sources may at least render them a pale shade of green. Worldwide, more than 40 percent of steel output and one-quarter of aluminum production is based on recycled scrap, possibly employing more than a quarter million people. Recycling and remanufacturing jobs worldwide number many millions, but incompatible definitions and a lack of data gathering make a global tally impossible. China alone is thought to have some 10 million jobs in this sector, and the United States has more than 1 million. In developing countries, recycling is often done by informal networks of scavengers. Brazil, which boasts a high rate of aluminum recycling, relies on some 500,000 scrap collectors. Cairo's 70,000 Zabaleen recycle as much as 85 percent of the materials they collect. Agriculture and forestry often still account for the bulk of employment and livelihoods in many developing countries. Small farms are more labor- and knowledge-intensive than agroindustrial farms are, and they use fewer energy and chemical inputs. But relatively sustainable forms of smallholder agriculture are being squeezed hard by energy- and pesticide-intensive farms and by global supply chains. Organic farming is still limited. But because it is more labor-intensive than industrialized agriculture, it can be a source of growing green employment. Afforestation and reforestation efforts, as well as better stewardship of critical ecosystems more generally, could support livelihoods among the more than 1 billion people who depend on forests, often through non-timber forest products. Planting trees creates large numbers of jobs, although these are often seasonal and low paid. Agroforestry, which combines tree planting with traditional farming, offers significant environmental benefits in degraded areas - including carbon sequestration. Some 1.2 billion people already depend on it to some extent. There is additional job potential in efforts to adapt to, and cope with, climate change. Building flood barriers, terracing land, and rehabilitating wetlands is labor-intensive work. Efforts to protect croplands from environmental degradation and to adapt farming to climate change by raising water efficiency, preventing erosion, planting trees, using conservation tillage, and rehabilitating degraded crop and pastureland can also support rural livelihoods. The potential for green jobs is immense. But much of it will not materialize without massive and sustained investments in the public and private sectors. Governments need to establish a firm framework for greening all aspects of the economy, with the help of targets and mandates, business incentives, and reformed tax and subsidy policies. It will also be critical to develop innovative forms of technology transfer to spread green methods around the world at the scale and speed required to avoid full-fledged climate change. Cooperative technology development and technology-sharing programs could help expedite the process of replicating best practices. To provide as many workers as possible with the qualifications they will increasingly need, an expansion of green education, training, and skill-building programs in a broad range of occupations is crucial. Resource extraction and energy-intensive industries are likely to feel the greatest impact in transitioning to a low-carbon future, and regions and communities highly dependent on them will need assistance in diversifying their economic base, creating alternative jobs and livelihoods, and acquiring new skills. This is known as a ""just transition."" Green jobs need to be decent jobs - offering good wages and income security, safe working conditions, dignity at work, and adequate workers' rights. Sadly, this is not always the case today. Recycling work is sometimes precarious, involving serious occupational health hazards and often generating less than living wages and incomes. Growing crops at biofuels plantations in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Malaysia, and Indonesia often involves excessive workloads, poor pay, exposure to pesticides, and oppression of workers. These cautionary aspects highlight the need for sustainable employment to be good not only for the environment but also for the people holding the jobs. Still, an economy that reconciles human aspirations with the planet's limits is eminently possible. ### Countries mentioned: Germany;Colombia;Brazil;United States;Malaysia;Indonesia;Egypt;India;China ### Programs found: sharing program;technology sharing program;effort project ### Measurements for interventions: wind power;recycling;solar thermal;thermal;solar photovoltaic;photovoltaic ### Topics keywords: organic farming;natural resource;renewable energy source;EC;rural community;carbon sequestration;contract farming;CC;developing country;rural livelihood;rural household;private sector;SC;agroforestry system;large scale;NT;many developing country;conservation tillage;soil organic carbon;energy consumption;rural area;biogas production;ecosystem service;cover crop;climate change;sustainable development;supply chain;renewable energy;crop residue;CT;employment opportunity ### Geo regions: North America;Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia;East Asia and Pacific;Middle East and North Africa;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2008,,Worldwatch Paper,,,,,,,#36804,,"",""
Optimization of production planningin Czech agricuhural co-operative via linear programming [Využití lineárního programování v optimalizaci osevního plánu zemědělského družstva v čr],"","Abstract: The production planning is one of the key managerial decisions in agricultural business, which must be done periodically every year. Correct decision must cover the agriculture demands of planting the crops such as crop rotation restrictions or water resource scarcity, while the decision maker aims to plan the crop design in most profitable way in sense of maximizing the total profit from the crop yield. This decision problem represents the optimization of crop design and can be treated by the methods of linear programming which begun to be extensively used in agriculture production planning in USA during 50's. There is ongoing research of mathematical programming applications in agriculture worldwide, but the results are not easily transferable to other localities due to the specific local restrictions in each country. In Czech Republic the farmers use for production planning mainly their expert knowledge and past experience. However, the mathematical programming approach enables find the true optimal solution of the problem, which especially in the problems with a great number of constraints is not easy to find intuitively. One of the possible barriers for using the general decision support systems (which are based on mathematical programming methods) for agriculture production planning in Czech Republic is its expensiveness. The small farmer can not afford to buy the expensive software or to employ a mathematical programming specialist. The aim of this paper is to present a user friendly linear programming model of the typical agricultural production planning problem in Czech Republic which can be solved via software tools commonly available in any farm (e.g. EXCEL). The linear programming model covering the restrictions on total costs, crop rotation, thresholds for the total area sowed by particular crops, total amount of manure and the need of feed crops is developed. The model is applied in real-world problem of Czech agriculture cooperative and the results of its solution are compared to the real decision made. The applicability of the model in every day agriculture managerial practice in Czech Republic is discussed and its possible enlargement is mentioned. ### Countries mentioned: Czechia;United States ### Topics keywords: crop rotation;decision support system;decision maker;decision making;decision support;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,Acta Universitatis Agriculturae et Silviculturae Mendelianae Brunensis,,,,,https://doi.org/10.11118/actaun200957060099,,#36251,,"",""
Participation in the CRP: implications of the New York experience.,"","Abstract: New York farmland owners were surveyed to gather information about the first 6 sign-ups for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). A high participation rate by nonfarmers provided evidence on the role tenure plays in the programme participation decision. Logistic regression analysis indicated that, compared with farmer participants, nonfarmer participants tend to own smaller farms, enroll larger acreages, and live adjacent to their enrolled fields. Compared with US Department of Agriculture-influenced but nonparticipating farmers, a second regression analysis indicated that participating farmers tend to own more large farms, be nondairy farmers, have nonfarm incomes, and use fewer soil conservation practices. Social norm and other attitudinal factors also were significant participation determinants. Efforts to target participation regionally based on the value of expected on-site and off-site benefits may be assisted by increasing programme flexibility and by outreach efforts to specific landowner groups. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Programs found: coordinated research project (CRP);conservation reserve program (CRP);conservation program (CRP);CGIAR global research program (CRP);core research project (CRP);conservation research program (CRP) ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;cover crop;soil erosion;regression analysis;crop insurance;conservation practice;BMP;USDA;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1989,,Journal of Soil and Water Conservation,,,,,,,#37400,,"",""
Partisan change in the post-key south,"","Abstract: By the first decade of the twenty-first century, more than fifty years after the publication of Southern Politics in State and Nation (1949), partisan change in the American South was a recognized fact of political life, creating not just a serious regional Republican Party but a truly nationalized party system (Black and Black 1987; Petrocik 1987; Rohde 1996; Polsby 2004; Lublin 2004). In fact, this partisan transformation was arguably the single largest change in the structure of American politics since the end of the Second World War. Nevertheless, more than half a century later, V. O. Key Jr. (1949) continued to structure the inescapable argument over the roots and trajectory of this change. Or at least, Southern Politics remained the critical text for understanding the partisan template, frozen in time for nearly a hundred years, out of which the new political world emerged. On the other hand, a disturbing share of Key's self-conscious disciples remained wedded to the argument of Southern Politics going forward, as if the master-rather than these acolytes-would have failed if this argument had to be adjusted in the face of new and different social forces. Transformation was indeed the product of two huge social changes, and most subsequent authors paid some heed to both. One was legal desegregation and an altered politics of racial identity. The other was economic development and an altered politics of social class. Key wrote in full awareness that these were the two grand categories of social change that had the potential to transform southern politics (See the foreword to this volume). At bottom, it is the comparative political contribution of these two great changes that remains, still, a matter of scholarly contention.1 The master himself was, in any case, clear enough about the standards for analysis of an evolving argument in an evolving region: Southern Politics had been path-breaking in its mobilization and application of electoral data in geographic format. If these data look uncomfortably ""ecological"" to the modern eye, being, as they are, not voting behavior by individuals but essentially voting outcomes by county for the eleven states of the old Confederacy, they were far less worrisome in their time. Which is to say: in matters of race, black disfranchisement was so extensive that ""the vote"" and ""the white vote"" were effectively coterminous in most areas. Likewise, in matters of class, a generally poor and largely agricultural economy lacked much of the differentiation- by sector or by income- That would come to characterize explosive economic growth in the postwar South. Regardless, within a very few years of the publication of Southern Politics, there appeared the obvious data set through which to update its argument- The gold standard for research on political behavior by the mass public-in the form of the ongoing American National Election Study. As a partisan of improved data-handling in political inquiry, as well as a major scholar who had stepped in personally to help institutionalize the ANES, Key would almost certainly have recognized that the proper basis for making assertions about change in mass partisanship in the American South was voting behavior as captured in these biennial surveys. There is, alas, a less polite side to that observation. The fact that the literature of southern politics kept asserting things about a partisan response to economic development and legal deseg- regation without systematically consulting the obvious data for documenting these assertions was a tendency that had to be hung on the acolytes, with rare few exceptions, and not on the master. To cut directly to the chase: in the South as anywhere else, observations about elite behavior, however closely observed and pungently reported, had no necessary connection with mass responses- To these elite actions or, as argued below, to social forces which proved to be much larger in their impact. The nature of such responses was instead a classic empirical question. Yet in theoretical terms, anyone who wanted to go hunting for an answer- To ask the relevant data about the coming of a new partisan politics to the postwar South-had to begin by structuring this inquiry in a way that separated, not lumped and elided, social class and racial identity. Careful distinctions might still disappear in the face of data that made them unnecessary. That would be a classic empirical result. But formulations that suppressed this distinction from the start could only confuse the analysis of a new southern politics. Accordingly, this examination begins by formulating two alternative but linked propositions, propositions that will guide most of what follows. From one side, Key's first great source of potential change, legal desegregation, argues that if a politics of racial identity were the driving force behind the rise of a southern Republican Party, then it should appear among whites where blacks were most numerous. From the other side, Key's second great source of potential change, economic development, suggests that if a politics of social class were instead the driving force, then a new southern Republican Party should appear within a new and rising white-collar population. In principle, these did not have to be alternative hypotheses. In practice, given that black areas were poor areas generally, it seemed likely that hypotheses formulated in this way were destined to become opposite, not parallel, in their implications. This is not to say that economic development and legal desegregation would not interact as social forces. It is only to say that they must be conceptualized (and measured) separately in order to be able to study this interaction. Yet there are two other parts to the story of partisan change that would still not be covered, even then. The first concerns the potential mediating impact of governmental institutions, especially Congress and the presidency here. In fact, the coming of legal desegregation and an associated politics of racial identity worked so differently between these two institutions that institutional structure must be addressed as a crucial part of the (mediated) impact of racial context. A second, potentially consequential, further part of the story concerns the great ""missing cleavage"" in Southern Politics in State and Nation, namely, religious background. V. O. Key saw racial identity as central to the story of the old South. He saw economic development as increasingly influential in the new. But in his time, at the historical moment when old southern patterns were still in place and change was not evidently under way, he saw no reason to pay attention to religious distinctions in considering the possibilities for partisan change. This was an entirely reasonable approach when looking back at a static southern politics in 1950, but it would become much less reasonable-in effect, a missing piece-for the study of an evolving southern politics thereafter. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Topics keywords: land use change;human activity;cultivated land;driving force ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Unlocking V.

Beyond threat- and asset-based approaches to natural resource management in Australia.,"","Abstract: Natural resource management (NRM) in Australia began as a series of campaigns against specific threats to agricultural and pastoral production, with war progressively declared on soil erosion, introduced pests and dryland salinity. Critiques of NRM programs in the 1990s coincided with a shift towards an asset-based approach. This approach emphasises the need for public investment to be focused on those parts of the landscape of high value, rather than defending large areas against broad-scale threats. The asset-based approach is more strategic, but runs the risk of sacrificing effectiveness for efficiency by overlooking the large-scale biophysical and social processes that underpin the viability of discrete assets. Further, the asset-based approach fails to sufficiently acknowledge the importance of engaging and building the human, social and cultural capital required to underpin long-term environmental management. A condition-based approach to NRM is proposed that builds on the best of the threat-based and asset-based approaches by setting targets based on environmental processes rather than perceptions of ideal states; borrowing systematic approaches to assessing value and condition from conservation planning; and investing in the social, economic, human and cultural capital required to support lasting change. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Programs found: natural resource management (NRM) program;critique natural resource management (NRM) program ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;natural resource;natural resource management;large scale;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2010,,Australasian Journal of Environmental Management,,,,,,,#37536,,"",""
Making country good: stewardship and environmental change in central Australian pastoral culture.,"","Abstract: Rural stewardship has been a focus of much natural resource management policy in Australia and elsewhere. Despite landowners professing stewardship, some researchers have cast doubt on the utility of the concept due to its vagueness and difficulties of associating attitudes with behaviour. In contrast I argue that stewardship should remain an important concept for understanding rural cultures, landholder practices and the politics of land. Stewardship, however, needs to be understood as emergent, as a 'dwelt achievement', as having temporal depth and as being part of the production of socio-natures. Moreover, as a key vernacular practice, its capacities and vulnerabilities require critical interpretation. I pursue these issues through an analysis of 20th-century pastoral stewardship in central Australian rangelands where land-use ideals have long been tested by aridity and low productivity. Arid zone pastoralism has also been subject to on-going critique and re-evaluation as ecological and other values challenge pastoral practice and the very presence of pastoralism. Pastoralists have responded with varying articulations of stewardship. These share consistent foundations even as their form changes. I use Anderson's idea (1997) of 'critical domestication' to underpin this analysis and show that pastoral stewardship has been, and continues to be, characterised by interpolations of order and chaos in nature and of continuity and discontinuity. With its focus on humanist ontologies of human distinction from the natural world rather than specific land-use ideals, critical domestication provides a framework for critically interpreting these interpolations in landscapes where ideals such as cultivation and closer settlement have not been achieved. Allying this framework with recent perspectives on the agency and materiality of nature, I also show that stewardship is not solely a human achievement, but is co-produced by environmental variability, plants and domestic and feral animals such as cattle and rabbits. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Topics keywords: land use;natural resource;natural resource management;decision making ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/tran.12025,,#36922,,"",""

Rapid appraisal and cost-effective participatory research in dry pastoral areas of West Africa.,"","Abstract: Special problems exist for data collection in pastoral areas. These are discussed together with experience in West Africa with methods which require the pastoralists to generate information about themselves. Plant indicators can be interpreted by ecologists and herdsmen to give estimates of carrying capacities. It is suggested that local knowledge could be enhanced by training some pastoralists in topics such as air photo interpretation. Livestock numbers, production characteristics and output can be recorded by pastoralists living in the camps who are supervised by a visiting researcher. Promising results of an experiment in Mali are reported and it is considered that the initial effort and expense of setting up such information networks is worthwhile. ### Countries mentioned: Mali ### Topics keywords: pest control;cost effective;economic benefit;BMP ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1981,,Agricultural Administration,,,,,,,#36210,,Abdrahmane Wane (2019-06-17 18:27:57)(Screen): Too old to be included; ,""
POPULATION ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF THE BARN OWL TYTO-ALBA IN FARMLAND HABITATS IN LIEMERS AND ACHTERHOEK (THE NETHERLANDS),"","Abstract: Over the last decades, the Barn Owl population has markedly decreased in range and breeding numbers in The Netherlands as in most western European countries. For effective conservation and population management, it is essential to know which factors are responsible for this decline. The present study deals with the Barn Owl population in the eastern part of The Netherlands. Population trends and demography (productivity, dispersal, mortality) were studied in two different districts (Liemers and Achterhoek) over two consecutive nine-year periods (1967-75 and 1976-84). Trends in population levels and demographic parameters are analysed in relation to external (environmental) factors, especially food supply, winter weather conditions, nest site availability and changes in rural landscapes and in farming practices. In Liemers the Barn Owl population has decreased markedly since 1960, especially in areas which have been subject to urbanisation and to large-scale land consolidation aimed at agricultural intensification. In contrast, in Achterhoek the Barn Owl population increased in the period 1965-85; landscape diversity is much better preserved in this district. More Barn Owls breed in small-scale mixed farmland than in large-scale uniform farmland. A significant, positive, correlation was found between the Barn Owl breeding density and the length of hedgerows, lines of trees and woodland edges. Both in Liemers and Achterhoek, no clear trends over time were noticed as regards breeding performance, dispersal patterns and mortality in adult Barn Owls. However, first-year mortality in Liemers in the second period (1976-84) proved to be higher than in the first period (1967-84) and in both periods in Achterhoek, In Liemers, productivity was too low to compensate for the high mortality in which road deaths took a heavy toll. This district proved to be a 'sink area', where the Barn Owl population persists only due to continuous net imports of owls. In contrast, Achterhoek is a 'source area' where productivity exceeds mortality. The relative importance of the various demographic parameters for the population balance is presented in a diagram (Fig. 25), which also gives a quantitative assessment of the sink (Liemers) and the source (Achterhoek). The key factors which limit Barn Owl numbers proved to be time- and region-dependent. In the 1980s, a continuing decline took place in the most devastated landscapes of Liemers, accounted for by progressive agricultural intensification and also by urbanisation and the expansion of the main road network. In contrast, the Barn Owl population increased in the better preserved mixed farmland of Achterhoek. The loss in nest site availability in the study region (which was great in the early years of the study period) has been offset by a major nestbox campaign, which proved to be very successful. Today over 90% of the Barn Owl pairs in Liemers and Achterhoek use these nestboxes for breeding. The mean number of young raised in nestboxes was significantly higher than that of 'free' nest sites. In Liemers the improved nest site availability could not stop the population decline. The proximate factors causing this decline are the loss of foraging habitat (disappearance of vole-rich areas, large-scale reduction of hedgerows) and the sharply increased traffic density (causing high road mortality rates). In the small-scale mixed farmland of Achterhoek, however, the Barn Owl population grew in parallel with the increased supply of nestboxes. This supports evidence that nest site availability is the environmental limiting factor in well-preserved landscapes with a rich and buffered food supply. The relationships between the most important external (environmental) factors and the main internal (demographic) parameters, as found in this study for the 1980s, are presented in a diagram (Fig. 35). A number of recommendations can be made for the protection of the Barn Owl and its habitat. These are summarized at the end of this article. Conservation measures should be linked to a land use strategy which favours not only the Barn Owl, but also broader conservation interests including historic-cultural values and the scenery in the wider countryside. Such a strategy will be profitable for other endangered birds and other scarce species associated with farmland. Monitoring of population trends of breeding birds in the study region showed that birds from seminatural habitats (open water, marshland, woodland) are relatively safe if they are non-migratory or winter in Europe. In contrast, many species breeding in farmland are threatened, in which Africa-migrants run double risks. There are better prospects for farmland birds with limited dispersals, such as the Barn Owl, Conservation measures regarding the local habitat (increasing the diversity in farmland environments including the supply of appropriate nest sites) certainly offer an opportunity for maintaining and increasing their breeding populations within a relatively short period of time (10-15 years). ### Countries mentioned: Netherlands ### Plant products search: figs ### Topics keywords: organic farming;last decade;land degradation;land consolidation;point view;weather condition;large scale;farming practice;agricultural intensification;farming system;paddy field;small scale;land use change;arable land;land reform;cultivated land;rural area;management practice;land use;specie richness;growing season;human activity;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1994,,ARDEA,,,,,,,#36508,,"",""
"Poultry farming in the cold, arid Himalayan region of India.","","Abstract: In the cold, arid Himalayan region of India, where the altitude is 3048-3658 m above mean sea level (MSL) and the temperature ranges from +35°C to -35°C, poultry farming is very difficult. Poultry farming in Leh-Ladakh has been a venture that has generally taken a back seat in this cold, arid region for a number of reasons. In this region, the Buddhist community makes up most of the population, and, because of their largely vegetarian lifestyle; they generally avoid killing animals in principal. Another reason is the lack of availability of any specific high yielding variety of layer or broiler breed in this high altitude region. Typically, the existing local poultry breeds exhibit very poor egg and meat production. Further factors which have influenced poultry production are the unavailability of poultry feed and the existence of harsh climatic conditions. The status of poultry rearing in this region is not encouraging, with the current total population of poultry birds limited to just a few thousand. There are many constraints contributing to this, including limited availability of feed, lack of subsidies, religious sentiments, lack of availability of suitable germ plasm, limited poultry feed ingredients, and poor knowledge regarding poultry farming. Furthermore, the housing of poultry is difficult in this cold, arid climate. Maintaining the optimum temperature of 25 to 35°C inside brooder and 15 to 20°C inside grower and layer housing requires modifications to the design of traditional poultry housing. The different types of housing available for use in this area are above- ground mud walled poly sheds, semi-underground mud or stone walled houses, trombay wall sheds and solar poultry houses. Fertility and hatchability are therefore the main problems in this area. The problems of poultry farming in high altitude and their solutions have been addressed in this paper. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Animal products search: poultry meat;eggs ### Topics keywords: winter wheat;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;long term ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2010,,World's Poultry Science Journal,,,,,,,#37515,,"",""

In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA), arranged in randomized complete block design, was employed to test the significance of price variable across the three market structures (i.e., farm gate price, rural market price, and urban market price). Marketing of forest fruits species is a profitable enterprise with an average profit of Naira19,123.37 per marketer per month. The analysis of variance for the two forest fruit species indicated that generated the highest annual income in rainforest ecosystem while generated the highest annual income in derived savanna ecosystem. Major constraints militating against these forest fruit species are poor market access and infrastructure development. The paper recommended among other things that domestication and interventions of these forest fruit species should be encouraged for proper management and sustainability. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Plant products search: fruits ### Topics keywords: randomized complete block design;fruit tree;annual income;ANOVA;developing country;poverty alleviation;rural household;agroforestry system;small scale;value chain;grain yield;significant difference;rural development;social capital;food security;analysis variance;dairy farming;smallholder farmer;market access ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2013,,ISRN Forestry,,,,,,,#37216,,"",""
Pre-industrial human and environment interactions in northern Peru during the late Holocene.,"","Abstract: The result of long-term environmental and human interaction is a variety of potential human responses to major natural crises: population aggregation or dispersal, changes in economic strategies and land use patterns, restructuring of social organization, increase in the incidence of conflict and warfare, and, in some instances, urban abandonment and cultural collapse. In the context of pre-industrial societies, two social processes with the greatest potential impact on the environment and on changing human-environmental interaction are urbanization and the development of diversified, regional-scale production systems such as intensive agriculture, pastoralism and exploitation of maritime resources. This paper employs archaeological and geological data from the Jequetepeque and Zana valleys on the north coast desert of Peru to study: (i) the specific responses of Moche, Chimu and Inca societies (∼ AD 250-1553) to major episodes of drought, El Niño flooding, and desertification; (ii) the social processes of urban-rural relations and economic diversification; and (iii) how these processes interacted within the dynamic arid north coast. Our research focuses on changing palaeoenvironmental regimes, agricultural infrastructures and domestic occupations to explore the complex interplay of cultural and natural forces that shaped the variable human responses and the history of urban-rural systems. Understanding the problem of how pre-industrial systems were sustained or failed in the context of interrelated social and environmental crises is an interdisciplinary objective, one that requires the integration of analytical techniques and theoretical frameworks of both the natural and social sciences as delineated in this study. ### Countries mentioned: Peru;Spain;Papua New Guinea ### Topics keywords: land use;anaerobic digestion;long term ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia;East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD;BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2004,,Holocene,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl704rp,,#37048,,"",""
Produce(ing) equity: Creating fresh markets in a food desert,"","Abstract: In the United States, the increasing availability of hormone, antibiotic, and pesticide-free food is largely limited by price and proximity to the upper and middle classes. Similarly, the burgeoning of urban farmers' markets and other direct marketing venues tend to benefit those who can afford locally raised food. Attempts to rectify this disparity are underway in the movement to link small farmers with residents of low-income neighborhoods in Louisville, Kentucky's largest city.

"Production and income in the Santa Tereza settlement, Porangatu municipality, Goiás State, Brazil.","","Abstract: This study was conducted to examine the economic performance of family farming at the Santa Tereza settlement, Porangatu, North of Goiás, Brazil. Data were collected by interviewing 45 families, during the 2001/2002 growing season. Factor analysis and a multiple regression model were used to explain profitability. The Santa Tereza settlement presents low rainfall, scarce water sources and a small market for their products. The government provided the farmers with subsidy and operating capital, but not with technical assistance or human capital training. Their main activities are dairy, swine, poultry, rice, and maize production. The small amount of working capital induces the adoption of labour intensive technology and small production scale (47.9% of the area is cultivated), and, as a consequence, 77.5% of family labour is not utilized. This explains the low productivity level and the high risk of the annual crops, however, all agricultural activities presented positive gross margin amounting to R$ 2188.00 per year. Dairy farming was the only activity that presented positive net income. Retirement income represents 65% of the family income. Factor and regression analyses showed that technical efficiency, and use of land resources and family labour, are directly related to better economic results, while annual crops and hired labour have negative effect on farm profitability. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: maize;rice ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: family labour ### Topics keywords: human capital;sweet potato;gross margin;factor affecting;net income;regression analysis;point view;taking account;beef cattle;GM;negative effect;small scale;crop rotation;human health;non GM;economic benefit;farm size;social capital;family farming;short term;growing season;factor influencing;dairy farming;human activity;technical assistance;technical efficiency ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2005,,Pesquisa Agropecuária Tropical,,,,,,,#36867,,"",""

Production potential of exotic vegetables in the southeastern United States,"","Abstract: During a three-year study, exotic vegetables were grown on a Decatur silt loam in north Alabama to assess adaptability, sustainability, yield, and quality. Initially, over 100 cultivars or plant introductions of nine vegetables were grown in observation rows to determine their suitability for conventional olericultural production practices with minimal pesticide input. From these, 51 varieties of nine vegetables were evaluated in replicated trials. Among the more productive adapted vegetables (highest yielding cultivar) were edible podded pea, Pisum sativum macrocarporn ('Little Sweetie': 4,663 Ibs/acre); long radish, Raphanus sativus ('Ha Kook KimJang': 4,641 Ibs/acre); vegetable soybean, Glycine max (Unnamed Variety, Porter & Son: 7,454 Ib/acre); seedless watermelon, Citrullus lanatus ('Quality': 36,931 Ibs/acre); yard-long bean, Vigna unguicalata sesquipedalis ('Green Pod Red Seeded': 15,173 Ibs/acre); mung bean, Vigna radiata (AVRDC VC 1482: 2,040 Ibs/acre); long eggplant, Solanum melongena ('Taiwan Long': 37,171 Ibs/acre); long cucumber, Cucumis sativus ('Burpless No. 26': 86,877 Ibs/acre); and Armenian cucumber, Cucumis melo ('Kakri Delhi Local': 49,531 Ibs/acre).

Modifying forestry and agroforestry to increase water productivity in the semi-arid tropics.,"","Abstract: The need to increase water productivity is a growing global concern as the World Commission on Water has estimated that demand for water will increase by c. 50% over the next 30 years and approximately half of the world's population will experience conditions of severe water stress by 2025. Three-quarters of African countries are expected to experience unstable water supplies, whereby small decreases in rainfall induce much larger reductions in streamflow. Vital water catchments have been lost or are being degraded, creating concerns about the loss of hydrological functions and increasing competition for scarce water resources between agriculture, urban centres, industry and wildlife. The challenge is to improve water productivity at the landscape or river basin level, especially for the rapidly growing populations in many developing countries. Water productivity is defined as the value or benefit derived from the use of water. In this review, we describe recent findings regarding the hydrology of forests and agroforestry systems and indicate how modifications to tree-based systems may increase water productivity in the semi-arid tropics. Throughout the tropics, reforestation using eucalyptus has been the most significant approach for modifying the water productivity of forestry and agroforestry systems. Fortunately, the 'eucalyptus dilemma' of providing local benefit at the expense of decreased streamflow for downstream users has been well articulated in many countries where evidence-based research has changed water policy and discouraged further planting of eucalyptus on water catchments. In East Africa, the most popular replacement for eucalyptus has been another exotic from Australia, Grevillea robusta, which has become the species of choice for farmers in the sub-humid highlands. However, attempts to introduce this species to semi-arid areas have been disappointing due to its evergreen canopy and consequently high demand for water. Current attempts to use deciduous species such as Melia volkensii and Paulownia fortunei in such areas are much more encouraging, although the long-term implications are still unknown. Agroforestry has the potential to improve water productivity in two ways. Trees can increase the quantity of water used on-farm for tree or crop transpiration and may also improve the productivity of the water that is used by increasing the biomass of trees or crops produced per unit of water used. Plot-level evidence shows that improvements in water productivity resulting from modifications to the microclimate experienced by crops may be limited. Instead, evidence from semi-arid areas of India and Kenya has shown that the greater productivity of agroforestry systems is primarily due to the greater quantity of water used. Further research is needed to examine the impact of the increased water use on drainage and base flow at the landscape level. Finally, we describe some of the technical approaches, which may be used to improve water productivity based on differences in tree phenology and the challenges facing smallholders in areas of growing water scarcity. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Australia;India ### Topics keywords: developing country;water saving;water scarcity;AFS;agroforestry system;long term;many developing country ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2006,,"CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1079/PAVSNNR20061065,,#36341,,"",""

Twenty-five interviews were conducted semi-structured, with beekeepers of the main rural communities in the municipality of Sierra's Honey. Producers interviewed understand that beekeeping is a lucrative activity. However, in spite of being organized into cooperatives, they have difficulty optimizing profits. The limitations on the formal educational training that hinder the ability management and the fragility of the organizational category, seem to be the factors that contribute most to this reality.

Program evaluation of rural resource improvement.,"","Abstract: Canadian agricultural development in certain regions has been impaired through adverse drainage conditions. Joint programmes have been developed by the federal and provincial governments to stimulate growth in those regions with little natural drainage, through subsidizing the construction of outlet drains which collect and dispose of water from surface and subsurface drains. This paper evaluates the agricultural drainage component of the programmes, particularly how drainage has contributed to the improvement of economic well-being of Eastern Ontario farmers. An asessment is also made as to whether or not outlet drainage is making a positive contribution to the overall national economy. Although, on average, drainage investment in the area investigated paid off from both a private and a public point of view, not all farmers benefited equally; some gained, others lost. Farmers receiving the greatest proportion of the benefits were those who adjusted their farm operation by installing subsurface drainage and by introducing high-value crops. The losers and those who gained little tend to be farmers who did not make these adjustments. In general, they were low income farmers who might have lacked the funds to do so. ### Countries mentioned: Canada;United States ### Programs found: agricultural drainage (AD) component program ### Topics keywords: factor influencing;point view;NO3 ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1987,,Demands on rural lands.

Predicting risk of credit default using discriminant approach: case of tribal dairy farmers of Jharkhand Platue.,"","Abstract: The credit support to the smallholder tribal families for the dairy development is an important source of viable mix of livelihood options and improving quality of life. The study has investigated the localized social factors that can be used by the credit institutions in risk rating a farmer-customer. The study has suggested that lower income from crop production, dairy and off-farm activities coupled with high expenditure proportionate to income and smaller number of earning adults in the family leaves only a smaller surplus with farmers making them to be a defaulter. The derived classification analysis has cross-verified the predicted variable and has found that the group classified correctly by 68.3% as factors of default. Thus, model was found valid in predicting a defaulter of loan-repayment based on the localized factors precisely. The study will address the concern of the credit institution in advance to assess the credit risk capital and risk adjusted outcome for serving a larger group of smallholders' community. ### Measurements for interventions: default ### Topics keywords: dairy farm;rural household;factor influencing",2015,,Indian Journal of Animal Sciences,,,,,,,#37222,,"",""
"Present and future effects of CO<sub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">2</sub> on various field crops: a general evaluation.","","Abstract: It was generally examined and been informed the present and future effects of carbon dioxide (CO) on field crops which were grown on the earth as morphologically, physiologically, agriculturally, etc. in this poster presentation. As known, agricultural sector is very sensitive to the global warming effects on field crops. Almost in each country, agriculture is the second or first largest direct or indirect contributor for the global warming. Especially, this phenomenon contributes to unwanted effect(s) through the emission of carbon dioxide (CO), methane (CH), nitrous oxide (NO), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), etc. Especially, from them CH has the highest global warming potential that is about 300 times than the potential of CO, and about 20 times than that of the NO. It was found that the average temperature of the Earth would be rise up to (1.4-5.8°C) by the 2100, and some agricultural practices (poly, mono and mixed cropping) and ecosystems (such as agro-forestry, agro-silvo-pastoral systems, landscape, aquaculture, rangelands, wetlands, fallows, etc.) will be affect at different levels. It was verified by the satellite images, increasing in the CO concentration (Its level in March 2016 is 404.83 ppm) will make accelerate plant growth, increase of water use efficiency (WUE) and physiological/metabolic activity (ies), reduce the grain filling period, nutrient efficiency, incubation and flowering periods.

Privatization and changing farm structure in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).,"","Abstract: The most striking feature of the land reform in the post-Soviet space has been the overall shift from collective to individual land tenure in agriculture, generally accompanied by privatization of legal land ownership. Individualization of farming has been among the main factors that acted to arrest the initial transition decline and to produce agricultural recovery in the region. In CIS countries, the recovery point for agricultural growth is closely linked with the observed watershed dates for individualization of farming. Furthermore, the rate and the attained level of recovery are higher in countries that pursued decisive individualization policies (Transcaucasus, Central Asia), while in countries with less sweeping individualization reforms (European CIS) the recovery has been sluggish. Land reform and individualization have also led to significant improvements in agricultural productivity due to the higher incentives in family farming. Greater production and higher productivity have contributed to significant poverty reduction since 2000. To ensure continued improvement of rural family incomes and poverty mitigation, policy measures should be implemented that facilitate enlargement of very small family farms and encourage the access of small farms to market channels and services. ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: land reform;developing country;land degradation;land ownership;rural household;land tenure;family farming;poverty reduction ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia",2015,,"Discussion Paper - Department of Agricultural Economics and Management, Hebrew University of Jerusalem",,,,,,,#36952,,"",""
Quality of water as affected by land-use.,"","Abstract: Overall inputs and outputs of certain major nutrients in 2 catchment areas under different land-use were studied. One area, occupying 3.40m2 (880 ha) was afforested, the dominant tree species being Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The other area, occupying 4.03m2 (1043 ha) was adjacent to it and comprised semi-natural grassland with Nardus stricta, Molinia caerulea, Agrostis tenuis and A.stolonifera as the dominant species. These 2 regions form, respectively, the headwaters of the rivers Severn and Wye. Both catchments occur on Silurian and Ordovician shales and show a similar range of soil series. Broadly, they reflect the 2 major types of land-use in upland Wales (ie forestry and low-intensity pastoral farming). Mean levels of Na and C1 were greater in the Severn than in the Wye; the opposite was true for Ca and Mg. K levels were similar in both. No levels for N are given. A lower pH of Severn water can be attributed to greater release of organic acids from the forest canopy or from the upper soil layers under coniferous forest.[28:132]. ### Countries mentioned: Norway;United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: NH4;land use;specie richness;NO3 ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1971,,"Report, Welsh Soils Discussion Group",,,,,,,#37366,,"",""
Quantifying postharvest loss of cabbage in the supply chain in Thailand,"","Abstract: Cabbage is an important leafy vegetable in Thailand, providing income to many small farmers, processors, and other entrepreneurs, and serving as a health food for rural and urban people. However, cabbage is inherently perishable. During the process of distribution and marketing, substantial losses are incurred which range from a slight loss of quality to total spoilage. Postharvest losses may occur at any point in the marketing process, from the initial harvest through assembly and distribution to the final consumer. The causes of losses are mainly physical damage during handling and transport, water loss, or sometimes simply because there is a surplus in the marketplace and no buyer can be found. The objective of this research was to quantify the postharvest loss of cabbage during transport from the farm to the retail market in Thailand with the optimum remaining leaves and positioning of cabbage on the truck in order to improve the cabbage transport system. The cabbage heads were divided into 4 groups at the farm (0, 2, 4 and 6 wrapper leaves). In addition, the cabbages were also positioned on the truck in different locations (9 locations) and then transported to collection centers, wholesale markets and retail markets. The postharvest losses of cabbage were quantified along the supply chain. The results showed that the highest postharvest loss of cabbage from farm to retail market was found in non-wrapper leaves of cabbages (22 %) while cabbages with 2, 4 and 6 wrapper leaves maintained the postharvest quality by protecting the cabbage head from bruising during transport at about 6, 3 and 2 %, respectively. Moreover, the different locations of cabbages on the truck also affected the severity of postharvest loss. The most severe loss of cabbage heads was found on the top layer of the truck at about 25 % loss in non-wrapper leaf cabbages and a little physical damage in the middle or bottom parts on the truck. Interestingly, cabbages with at least 2 or more wrapper leaves were the most effective in maintaining the postharvest quality during transport from farm to retail market. In this research, we recommended that cabbage farmers keep at least 2 wrapper leaves after harvest to prevent bruising of the cabbage head during transport and. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Plant products search: leafy vegetables ### Topics keywords: post harvest;organic farming;EC;supply chain;insect pest;SC;healthy food ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2013,,"Conference Proceeding - 5th International Conference, TAE 2013: Trends in Agricultural Engineering 2013",,,,,,,#37474,,"",""
"Reaching farmers through high quality seed multiplication and dissemination in Nueva Ecija, Iloilo, and Bohol.","","Abstract: Increasing rice production and income of small farmers is always a challenge in Philippine agriculture. New approaches have to be explored so that farmers themselves can work together to achieve their goal of increased productivity and income. High quality seeds is one of the most important needs of farmers especially those who could not afford to buy. To address this problem, the Korea Program on International Agriculture (KOPIA) in collaboration with the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), LGUs and DA Regional Offices, implemented the seed multiplication and dissemination project to guarantee farmer's access to high quality seeds. The strategy involves lending farmers high quality seeds of the variety they chose at the start of planting season and after harvest they will return the equivalent cash of PhP1,000.0 per sack to the cooperative where they belong. The amount generated becomes the seed money of the cooperative which members can borrow to help finance their farm operations. Four years after the implementation of the collaborative study, the Bantug Primary Multi-Purpose Cooperative, in the Science City of Munoz, Nueva Ecija generated PhP1,279,050.00 and farm machines. Meanwhile, Bohol Farmers Multi-Purpose Cooperative in Pilar, Bohol generated PhP1,257,271.08 and a milling machine whereas the Sinibaan Farmers' Association in Dingle, lloilo generated PhP 479,000.00 and irrigation facilities that service nearly 100 ha of rice field. Capacity enhancement through farmers' trainings on each site and free educational tour to South Korea were conducted to increase their knowledge on new technologies. Overall, this collaborative study is geared towards helping the government in achieving rice security and in helping farmers and their cooperative to increase income and capacity to expand rice farming operations. ### Countries mentioned: Paraguay;Philippines;Korea;Korea ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: dissemination project;korea program ### Topics keywords: contract farming;decision making;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2018,,Philippine Journal of Crop Science,,,,,,,#36720,,"",""
Recent advances in cassava pest management,"","Abstract: Cassava (Manihot esculenta) occupies a uniquely important position as a food security crop for smallholder farmers in areas of the tropics where climate, soils, or societal stresses constrain production. Given its reliability and productivity, cassava is the most important locally produced food in a third of the world's low-income, food-deficit countries. It is the fourth most important source of carbohydrates for human consumption in the tropics, after rice, sugar, and maize. World production of cassava from 1994-1996 averaged 166 million tons/year grown on 16.6 million hectares (ha), for an average yield of 9.9 tons/ha. Approximately 57% is used for human consumption, 32% for animal feed and industrial purposes, and 11% is waste. Africa accounts for 51.3% of the production; Asia, 29.4%; and Latin America, 19.3%.

Recognising and supporting local innovation: an alternative approach to horticulture for development [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Important changes in approaches to research and development have taken place to ensure that the outcomes are more relevant to small-scale farmers' circumstances. Various organisations that recognise farmers’ ability to innovate and to experiment informally in order to overcome challenges or to test ideas have started to support this process actively. Using cases of local innovation as a starting point ensures that research and development efforts are based on farmers’ motivations. Involvement of small-scale farmers in identifying research needs, planning and conducting the experiments, and evaluating the outcomes helps to ensure that the findings are relevant to them. Since 2004, a network that promotes local innovativeness and participatory approaches to research and development has been active in South Africa. Partners are engaged in several cases of joint innovation by small-scale farmers and local development organisations. After a general introduction to the concepts and process of promoting local and joint innovation, three such cases from KwaZulu-Natal Province are presented briefly. The first is an investigation into a farmer-developed practice for backyard potato-growing that involves mulching with crop residues. The second concerns smallholders’ testing of cherry pepper and involves partnership with a commercial farmer who helps the smallholders address marketing needs. The third is a case of a locally developed fencing practice to keep livestock out of the vegetable garden. Such an innovation allows resource-poor farmers to adopt gardening practices recommended by HIV/AIDS programmes. The cases illustrate the roles that local innovation can play in horticulture for development and the types of support that can be provided by development workers and researchers. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: pepper;potatoes;stone fruits ### Programs found: almost ideal demand system (AIDS) program ### Topics keywords: small scale;drought stress;SA;crop residue;extension service;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2011,,Acta horticulturae,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44629231&site=ehost-live,,#37061,,"",""
"Report of the workshop on 'Pastoral communities in the Near East: traditional systems in evolution'. Amman, Jordan, 1-5 December 1991.","","Abstract: This paper presents a report of a workshop, organized by FAO and CARDNE (the Regional Centre for Agrarian Reform and Rural Development in the Near East), on pastoral communities in the region, held in Amman, Jordan, 1-5 December 1991. The workshop provided a venue for the exchange of ideas on the traditional range management systems of the region and their recent evolution with a view to studying the current social and economic changes and their long-term implications and to identify a common policy platform. The specific objectives of the workshop were to hold technical discussions on the major issues of concern for the development of pastoral populations in the region, to assess the problems, changes and trends and to make recommendations on policies and programmes that would reflect the aspirations of the populations in a participatory manner. Case studies were provided from Jordan, the Syria- Iraq-Turkey border, Iraq, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran. Major issues were identified: rangeland degradation; rangeland speculation; pastoralists' loss of political power; non-acceptance of the legal framework; carrying capacity; underutilization of peripheral areas; range versus forage crops; cost-effectiveness of range investment; focus on development programmes; pastoralist- farmer relations; pastoralist mobility; planning. Major conclusions and recommendations fell under five headings: the need for a policy platform for pastoral people; land tenure; participation; identification of economically viable and ecologically sustainable pastoral systems; the need for research. As well as a list of participants and an agenda, this publication also includes as appendices two papers delivered at the workshop. The first is a keynote address, entitled 'The revival of traditional pastoral systems in the Near East' (J. Janzen). It maintains that the destruction of pasture land is not primarily a natural phenomenon but rather a socioeconomic and political-legal problem. Praising the hima, the traditional range management system of the region, it calls for two main measures: drastic reduction of livestock numbers; the re- introduction of traditional management systems. The second paper (A. W. Qureshi) 'Biological limits to animal production from pastoralism in the Near East' points out the limits to increasing livestock production from rangelands in the region and describes the major factors determining these limits, as well as discussing development issues which are relevant to the sustainable management of natural resources in the pastoral systems of production. The report concludes with appendices containing the recommendations of the three working groups. Group 1 deals with land tenure, water resources and the identification of range users. Group 2 deals with land tenure, participation and income generation. Group 3 deals with land tenure, identification of range users and identification of economically viable and ecologically sustainable pastoral systems and recommends further studies. ### Countries mentioned: Lebanon;Saudi Arabia;Turkey;Iraq;Oman;Yemen;Jordan;Iran ### Programs found: development program;policy program;rural development program (RDP);rural development (RD) program ### Topics keywords: natural resource;land reform;land degradation;RDP;agrarian reform;rural development;land tenure;FAO;long term ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1991,,"Report of the workshop on 'Pastoral communities in the Near East: traditional systems in evolution'.

"Reproductive performance of camels (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Camelus dromedarius</i>) under pastoral management and its influence on herd development.","","Abstract: Camels produce milk and offspring and provide transport in pastoral husbandry systems in the Afro-Asian dryland belt. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reproductive performance of camels kept under pastoral management in northern Kenya. Using the Progeny History surveying technique, data were collected from 471, 287 and 416 adult Rendille, Gabra and Somali female camels including data on 1506, 789 and 1206 parturitions, respectively. Surveys took place from January to December 1995, but data refer to the 15-year production period preceding the survey. Age at first calving (AFC) was 58.4±1.0 months (LSMeans±S.E.), 63.0±1.1 months and 68.4±1.3 months for the Somali, Rendille and Gabra camels, respectively. The mean calving interval was similar for all three populations with 27.3±0.6 months (LSMeans±S.E.) for Rendille camels, 28.0±0.6 months for Gabra (=500) and 28.4±0.6 months for Somali camels. The annual calving rate varied between 33% and 46% in the Somali, 19% and 44% in the Gabra and 8% and 86% in the Rendille camel population. Calf mortality rate averaged 25%, 22% and 27% in Rendille, Gabra and Somali camel calves, respectively, and showed highest variation between the years in the Rendille system (5% to 60%). The number of adult breeding females increased by about 20% over a simulation period of 10 years using the status quo reproductive parameters and by about 70% with improved AFC and CI (excluding AFC &gt; 78 months and CI &gt; 36 months). The results reveal the usual and unusual variation in the reproductive parameters over different years and in the different systems. It is concluded that eliminating unusual variation is a promising way to enhance herd development and reduce risk in the production systems. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Somalia ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: community initiative (CI) ### Topics keywords: calving interval;dairy cow;reproductive performance;AFC;confidence interval;dairy cattle;CI ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2005,,Livestock Production Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.livprodsci.2004.06.016,,#36350,,"",""

"Residual benefits of promiscuous soybean to maize (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Zea mays</i> L.) grown on farmers' fields around Minna in the southern Guinea savanna zone of Nigeria.","","Abstract: Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by promiscuous cultivars of soybeans ( (L.) Merr.) in cereal-based cropping systems of Nigeria's moist savanna zone offers a potential for minimizing the investment made by resource-poor farmers on nitrogen fertilizers. A 3-year trial was conducted on five farmers' fields in the southern Guinea savanna zone of Nigeria to assess the residual effects of two successive crops of promiscuous soybean cultivars on the yield of a following maize ( L.) crop. The soybean cultivars, TGX1456-2E (medium maturity) and TGX1660-19F (late maturity), were grown in 1996 and 1997. Treatments, imposed only in the first year of the trial, were: (i) uninoculated, (ii) inoculated with a mixture of two strains, and (iii) fertilized with 60 kg N ha. A fourth treatment was a plot left to fallow. In 1998, all the previous soybean and fallow plots were sown to maize without any fertilizer application. Results in 1996 and 1997 showed a soybean response to inoculation in the first year, but differences due to the residual effect of inoculation in the second year were not significant. Both cultivars showed a similar response to inoculation but responses at the five sites were varied. Soybean cultivar 1456-2E fixed 43-52% of its N amounting to 56-70 kg N ha and cultivar 1660-19F derived 39-54% of its N from N-fixation which amounted to 51-78 kg N ha. Both cultivars had a high N harvest index resulting in a net removal of 52-95 kg N ha when both grain and stover were exported. Even when the stover was returned, there was a depletion of 23-65 kg N ha, with 1456-2E removing more N than 1660-19F. Arbuscular-mycorrhizal infection on maize roots was 11-27% and dependent on previous soybean treatments and farmers' fields. Plant height, shoot biomass, grain yield, and N uptake of maize were significantly greater in plots previously sown to soybean than in the fallow plots. In general, plots sown to the late maturing cultivar 1660-19F exhibited better residual effect, producing larger yield parameters than the plots planted with medium maturing 1456-2E. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Guinea;Guinea-Bissau ### Plant products search: soybeans;maize;grain ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;paddy field;AMF;arbuscular mycorrhizal;plant height;cropping system;harvest index;NH4;use efficiency;TP;N uptake;NO3;NH4 N;zea may L;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2003,,Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(03)00197-X,,#37274,,"",""
Restoring soil fertility in sub-sahara Africa,"","Abstract: Sub-Sahara Africa can overcome the soil fertility depletion that has resulted from decades of nutrient mining by small-scale farmers and threatens the region's food security. Nutrient restoration is now technically feasible because its mechanisms are understood and the rural development community is alerted to this need. Rapid and inexpensive approaches of diagnosing soil fertility limitations are also becoming available and information generated is becoming systematically applied. For example, the recently initiated Africa Soil Information Service project aims at evaluating, mapping, and monitoring Africa's soil qualities for better targeting of soil fertility management technologies to improve crop yields while enhancing the environment. Practical knowledge is available on nutrient management in small-scale farming systems that combines increased biological nitrogen fixation, utilizes agromineral resources such as phosphate rock, better uses organic resources, and more efficiently applies mineral fertilizers. The new approach to managing soil nutrients, recognized as integrated soil fertility management, aims to increase food production through strategic combination of traditional and new technologies and is being stimulated through increased availability and more profitable use of mineral fertilizers by Africa's poorer farmers. This is building on already existing sparks of hope for restoring soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa derived from such examples as the increasing adoption of the zaï-type of pitting system originated in drier parts of West Africa which exemplifies the beneficial effects of integrating harvesting of water and applying nutrient sources at each planting station so as to increase yield in a region where both necessities are key limiting factors. Nitrogen fixation by indigenous and introduced legumes combined with improved agronomic practices has shown potential for kick-starting self-multiplying improvements in soil productivity. Such successes will be accelerated by broader initiatives which improve rural infrastructure, increase accessibility of inputs, improve marketing facilities, and make reinvestment into farming more productive and sustainable. Indeed, experience indicates that investments in farming and, by inference, soil fertility conservation are made when economic returns from smallholder production are sufficient to do so. So, while technical advances leading to improvements in farming practice must continue, policymakers must also recognize that agriculture ultimately forms the basis for economic recovery and act upon past promises to invest in agriculture, including the restoration of nutrient-depleted soils. Investments must address factors that have impacts both on the broad reforms for provision of services such as marketing and trade, as well as those directly constraining the poor farmers such as capacity to access and efficiently apply fertilizers. ### Plant products search: legumes ### Programs found: africa soil information service project;broad initiative;service project;broader initiative ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;integrated soil fertility;organic farming;land degradation;soil fertility;NPK;SSA;small scale farmer;farming practice;farming system;small scale;crop rotation;rural development;management practice;food security;organic fertilizer;mineral fertilizer;extension service;sewage sludge;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2010,,Advances in Agronomy,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2113(10)08004-1,,#37130,,"",""
Private provision after public neglect: bending irrigation markets in North Bihar.,"","Abstract: Research in northeast Bihar, India, shows public sector irrigation management to be embodied within the prevailing cultural structures of the region, involving the intrusion of local exchange behaviour into the practices of public allocation of water. With irrigation officials in strong rent-seeking positions over farmers, and without resort to a moral sense of community through which farmers might exert their position over official providers, opting out into private provision via tube-well borings and pumpsets has become the exit solution. However, the propensity to make even relatively small investments in bamboo borings is dependent upon access to pumpsets. While élite families own the pumpsets in a village, some farmers may have borings on just some of their land, and others may have no borings of their own at all. Farmers therefore have to enter into multi-layered transactions in order to secure access to timely water. Secure access to other inputs is also necessary. The paper encapsulates the themes of: state versus common property resources management; the 'incentives' induced by costs of loyalty and the availability of exits to adopt private solutions; and the social embeddedness of behaviour when operating in interlocked, community level markets. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: tuber ### Topics keywords: contract farming;public sector;land reform;extension service ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1999,,Development and Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-7660.00137,,#37521,,"",""
Reaching the poor: effectiveness of the current shallow tubewell policy in Nepal.,"","Abstract: Expanding groundwater irrigation in Terai is important for Nepal to meet its increasing food requirements and for poverty alleviation. The current government policy, since 2000, aims to help small and poor farmers in investing in group-based Shallow Tubewells (STWs), by providing various support services, instead of a direct cash subsidy. This paper evaluates the outcomes in the two sites among many, where this policy has been implemented through a government project. Poverty alleviation and STW irrigation expansion, the two main goals of the new policy, are difficult to be achieved simultaneously. Although small and poor farmers now have a higher rate of access to STWs, it still fails to benefit the poorest such as tenant farmers and those without legal land entitlement. The process is further slowed down due to small landholding sizes and the time consumed in organizing small farmers. The paper suggests that promoting individual STWs through rural electrification could be a more effective policy for a faster groundwater development and poverty alleviation. ### Countries mentioned: Nepal ### Programs found: governmental project;government project ### Topics keywords: small scale;poverty alleviation;rural household;rural development;food security ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2009,,Groundwater governance in the Indo-Gangetic and Yellow River Basins: realities and challenges,,,,,,,#37017,,"",""
Recent changes in pastoral systems. Case study on Kyrgyzstan.,"","Abstract: Traditional livestock in mountainous regions of Kyrgyzstan is the main leading direction of agriculture, its share in gross output structure makes about 40%. During the Soviet Union, the maximum number of sheep in Kyrgyzstan has reached over 11 million heads. According to bioclimatic conditions of the area of the utilised pastures seasonal pastures available covered in summer 3.9 million ha, in spring and autumn 2.7 million ha and in winter 2.3 million ha. Because of a command economy with central planning institutions and an intensification of livestock the condition of pastures reached on average a strong degree of degradation. Along with this centuries-old traditional knowledge and practices to utilise pastures tended to be forgotten. The role of pastures remains to be very important not only in the human-environmental system of Kyrgyzstan, but also for the regional economy. During the initial years after independence and after the implementation of agrarian and land reforms in the country the agricultural sector suffered from an economic crisis and the number of sheep and cattle greatly diminished. Consequently, the condition of specific pastures has been significantly improved since. However, in recent years, the number of sheep and cattle slowly increases by the demand for meat consumption in the country and from neighbouring states, i.e. number of sheep has reached more than 4 million, cattle 1.1 million and horses 350 thousands. Along with the conventional use of pastures for animal husbandry multi-functional use of pasture for beekeeping, eco-tourism and collecting medicinal herbs have been introduced. However, today the majority of pastoralists are trying to settle in pastures that are close to water sources and along tracks. Subsequently, these areas experience severe degradation close to the settlements while remote highland pastures are not used and abandoned. To address this challenge the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic has passed the Law ""On pastures"" on December, 18th, 2009. Since then all pastures that are no longer transferred to rental use will be managed by pasture committees and associations of pasture users at local level. A pressing issue at the moment is to define the borders of pastures at the local, district and provincial levels, as well as the determination of tariffs for the use of pasture (through pasture use tickets). ### Countries mentioned: Kyrgyzstan ### Animal products search: meat ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;traditional knowledge;land reform;rural community;medicinal plant ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2011,,"Pastoralism and rangeland management in mountain areas in the context of climate and global change.

Resource flow mapping as a tool for improving soil organic matter management in small-holder hillside farms in Nicaragua.,"","Abstract: The purpose of this study was to map nutrient resource flows as a tool for improving soil management on small-holder hillside farms in Nicaragua. Eight farms were chosen situated on the hillsides of the Wibuse and Jicaro Uno watersheds located in the San Dionisio municipality of Matagalpa department, Nicaragua. Participatory Rural Appraisal tools were used to gather information about the farms' major resource inputs and outputs as well as resource flows within the farm. Data were collected during two thorough interviews with each farmer on the eight selected farms. During the first interview, relevant components of the farm were surveyed and mapped according to the NUTMON software (Monitoring Nutrient Flows and Economic Performance in Tropical Farming Systems), and we also gathered information about the farmer's situation, everyday life and current land use practices. Quantification of resource flows within and also in and out of the farm was done together with the farmer during the second interview. The farmers lived in plain houses close to their fields, out of which 40% were steep or very steep. As much as 50% of cultivated area had some kind of erosion barriers but the quality of these varied widely. All eight farmers interviewed proclaimed that they no longer used the method of slash and burn. The land was managed by hand with simple tools, such as machetes. Maize and beans are the most common crops grown in the area, but some farmers grew small amounts of crops such as sorghum, yuca [cassava], coffee and bananas. Herbicides were used to a great extent to prepare the fields for most crops. Insecticides are used on both maize and beans but fertilizers are applied on maize only. Bean production varied, for the studied year, between 6 and 20 qq/mz (390-1300 kg/ha), although on two farms production failed and gave close to nothing. Maize production varied between 5 and 35 qq/mz (325-2275 kg/ha). On the field with the lowest production, neither fertilizers nor herbicides were used. The studied year was, according to the farmers, a bad cropping year. There was no recycling of household waste, such as composting kitchen scraps, nor was the manure produced on the farm returned to the fields. All farmers kept poultry and most of them also kept pigs. These animals received maize and sorghum as extra fodder. There were also farmers who owned horses and cattle, which in general got no extra fodder or nutrients but were allowed to graze on crop residues left in the fields. The NUTMON software was used to simulate the resource flows and calculate nutrient balances for two of the farms investigated. The number of simulations were too few to draw any general conclusions on how farm management affects the nutrient content of the soil. However, the experience gained during this study can be used to identify areas in the method that need to account for local conditions and to point out difficulties that the user can come across when using the software. ### Countries mentioned: Nicaragua ### Plant products search: yuca;sorghum grain;maize;cassava;grain legumes;bananas ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Topics keywords: DM;soil fertility;land use;OM;nutrient balance;crop residue;farming system;organic matter;SOM ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2002,,"Minor Field Studies - International Office, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences",,,,,,,#37565,,"",""
Response of maize to phosphorus from fertilizer and chicken manure in a semi-arid environment of South Africa [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Chicken manure is a potential source of plant available phosphorous (P) and this field study explored its use for dry land maize production in a soil with very low inherent P levels. The treatments consisted of applying 0, 20, 40 and 80 kg P ha-1 each from chicken manure (2.3% P), inorganic fertilizer (single super phosphate, 10.5% P) and a combination of manure and fertilizer. The treatments were replicated four times in a randomized complete block design over two crop seasons. The results revealed that maize growth and yield responded to the P from both manure and fertilizer compared to the control. There were significantly (p < 0.05) taller plants and yield (grain and biomass) in maize supplied with P than control. At each level of P application however, the response was higher for fertilizer than manure. The combination of manure and inorganic fertilizer produced results that were in the middle. There were strong indications that application of chicken manure was associated with increased lodging possibly due to the additional N in the manure, attack by stalk borer (Buseola fusca) and reduced seedling emergence. The application of chicken manure on the other hand led to increased pH and greater residual P content of the soil than fertilizer. It is concluded that chicken manure presents a viable option for supplying P to sustain maize crops in the smallholder farming sector of South Africa and its management warrants further investigation in view of the potential adverse impacts on soil and water resources that can accrue when large amounts are used for a long period. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: chicken manure ### Topics keywords: organic fertilizer;drought stress;SA;soil fertility;NPK;randomized complete block design;inorganic fertilizer;NH4;smallholder farming;FYM;available phosphorus;chicken manure;NO3;smallholder farmer;farming system;organic matter;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2009,,Experimental agriculture,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44231473&site=ehost-live,,#37232,,"",""
"Response of rainfed bread and durum wheat to source, level and timing of nitrogen fertilizer on two Ethiopian Vertisols: II. N uptake, recovery and efficiency","","Abstract: In trials conducted at 2 highland Vertisol sites in Ethiopia in 1990 and 1991, 2 locally popular wheat cultivars, 1 spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 1 durum wheat (T. durum Desf.), were supplied with nitrogen (N) fertilizer at 0, 60 and 120 kg N ha-1 in the form of large granular urea (LGU), standard urea prills or ammonium sulfate. N was applied all at sowing, all at mid-tillering or split-applied between these two stages (1/3:2/3). While durum wheat exhibited the highest N concentration in grain and straw, bread wheat, because of its higher productivity, resulted in a greater grain and total N uptake. In general, split application of N and use of LGU as N source enhanced grain and total N uptake, apparent N recovery and agronomic efficiency of N, particularly under severe water-logging stress. Where significant, the interactions among the experimental factors substantiated the superior responsiveness of the bread wheat cultivar to fertilizer N, and the beneficial effects of split N application and LGU as an N source. Split application of N tended to nullify the positive effects of LGU, presumably by approximating the delayed release of N achieved with LGU. Considering the potential benefits to Ethiopian peasant farmers and consumers, split application of N should be advocated, particularly on water-logged Vertisols; LGU could be an advantageous N source assuming a cost comparable to the conventional N source urea. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: grain;wheat ### Measurements for interventions: fertilizer ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;triticum aestivum L;TN;winter wheat;NH4;use efficiency;TP;N uptake;NO3;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1995,,Fertilizer Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00750926,,#37028,,"",""
"Risk indicators associated with <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Staphylococcus aureus</i> subclinical mastitis in smallholder dairy cows in Tanzania.","","Abstract: A cross sectional study was carried out between June and September 2003 to establish the prevalence and related risks indicators for subclinical mastitis on smallholder dairy herds in Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania. 191 lactating cows from 64 randomly selected herds were investigated. However, due to such reasons as aggressive cow, blind quarters and presence of open teat wound, the California mastitis test (CMT) was carried out on 726 (9 cows and 2 quarters were not sampled) quarter milk samples. Herd (at Least one positive quarter per cow), cow and quarter level prevalence of subclinical mastitis defined by CMT ≥ + were 100%, 91.2% and 85.0% respectively. was isolated in 21.0% of the 718 (11 cows and 2 quarters were not sampled) - bacteriologically examined quarter milk samples. The cow and quarter level prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis, defined by positive CMT (≥ +) score and positive culture, was 97.4% and 98.0%, respectively. Water availability, residual suckling, single udder-towel, poor housing sanitation, teat-Lesions and the failure to use dry-cow therapy were the most substantial (p&lt;0.05) risk indicators. It is concluded that intensive and continuous farmer education programmes particularly focusing on subclinical mastitis prevalence and ways to reduce or eliminate these infections, are necessary to improve udder health in Tanzania. These issues are discussed at the end of the paper. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: education program;continuous farmer education program;farmer education program ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: mastitis;CM ### Topics keywords: value chain;dairy cow;lactating cow;dairy industry;dairy farm;dairy herd;smallholder dairy;dairy cattle;dairy farming ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2005,,Mastitis in dairy production: current knowledge and future solutions,,,,,,,#37386,,"",""
Risk management strategies of smallholder farmers in the Eastern Highlands of Ethiopia.,"","Abstract: This thesis investigates the relationship between various types of agricultural risks and socioeconomic-cultural characteristics of households, opportunity variables and other pertinent factors in the rural society of Ethiopia. The study utilizes both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection and analysis from March 2000-September 2001. The results reveal that households in the Eastern Highlands of Ethiopia are vulnerable to a wide variety of risks that can materially disrupt different aspects of their livelihoods. In the first article, it is shown that the major risks are production risk, financial risk, health risk, institutional and political risk. These are both covariate risks that may take the form of widespread shocks such as drought, or idiosyncratic risks such as localized shocks or health problems. It emerges that risks are perceived by different local actors in varying ways depending on differences in asset endowments, locational settings and different dimensions of livelihood diversification strategies pursued by the farmers. Article II focuses on estimation and characterization of perceived risks, mainly on income, price and yield variability. The analysis shows that drought, pests and diseases, higher prices of cereals at purchase, and drought coupled with pests and diseases are very frequent and distributionally neutral. Proximity to the market and the number of cattle owned by the households are found to be the strong determinants of household income during both 'good' and 'bad' years. Article III analyses what determines access to risk information and learning that is vital in the risk reduction and mitigation process. The main messages are that distances from markets and number of plots owned by the farmers have significant associations with access to information. Self evaluation of knowledge, a proxy for learning, is found to be significantly associated with differences in gender, marital statuses and educational level of household head as well as number of cattle owned and farm size. Some important messages emerge from the 4th article. Firstly, farmers perceived that financial, diversification, and marketing responses, are important management tools in risk mitigation and sustenance of their livelihoods. Secondly, responses to risks are differentiated across opportunity variables, wealth status, diversification and human capital-related variables. This dissertation argues that the trend of increased reliance on ex post responses to risks needs to be reversed as farmers would benefit more from invigorating ex ante, preventive, risk management instruments. The impetus of this study is that understanding some important factors (varying perceptions of risks, risk information, learning and risk responses of farmers) could serve as a solid basis in the efforts of articulating sensible grassroot level risk reduction strategies with the view of reducing various dimensions of poverty in the Eastern Highlands of Ethiopia. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia;Papua New Guinea ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: human health;rural household;health risk;risk assessment;household income;human capital;farm size;heavy metal;smallholder farmer;social capital ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",2003,,Acta Universitatis Agriculturae Sueciae - Agraria,,,,,,,#36639,,"",""

Roles of small ruminants in rural livelihood improvement - comparative analysis in Egypt.,"","Abstract: The study focuses on the assessment of the contribution of sheep and goats to reduce poverty and vulnerability in rural farming systems of three agroecological areas in Egypt: the pastoral area of the Northwestern coast (Matruh governorate), the irrigated areas of the Nile Valley (Sohag governorate) and the oasis area of the West Desert (New Valley governorate). An empirical study on 90 farms in the three agroecological areas on different social and economic indicators related to poverty gave indicators on the roles of sheep and goats in different farm types according to resource endowment (e.g. land, livestock, capital) and human resources. The results showed that sheep and goats provided the main source of income to landless and very small land owners to escape the poverty trap. Moreover, the livestock asset generated other sources of wealth that were not taken into account in the monetary poverty approach. ### Countries mentioned: Egypt ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;small ruminant;natural resource;comparative analysis;rural livelihood;take account;rural community;rural household;point view;taking account;taken account;animal health;farming system ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Revue d'Élevage et de Médecine Vétérinaire des Pays Tropicaux,,,,,,,#36568,,"",""

Rural labor policies in the agricultural development strategies of the People's Republic of China.,"","Abstract: Data limitations make it impossible to discuss Chinese labour policy in terms of specific projects, goals, objectives, or programme evaluations. The aim of the paper is therefore to discuss labour policy only on the macro level with more emphasis on trends than on micro results. It also attempts to show how labour policy fits into the broader Chinese development plan, i.e. the possible interaction between employment policy and technical change, etc. The first two sections give a broad overview of the demographic and geographic characteristics of the Chinese agricultural sector. The next section discusses rural organization since 1949 including a historical overview of the step-by-step collectivization process which moved the countryside within a decade from a disjointed collection of small farmers to a highly centralized system of communes. There is then an account of the present state of rural organization and the changes that have taken place in the last 15 years, followed by a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of collectivization as related to employment policy. The next four sections are devoted to a more detailed explanation of the four main thrusts of Chinese employment policies: labour force participation, utilization, productivity, and incentives. In the following sections the major tools used by the Chinese to increase labour productivity in the rural areas are looked at: agricultural investment; mechanization; water control and irrigation; chemical fertilizers; and agricultural research. The evidence clearly indicates that China has succeeded in increasing both labour force utilization and participation rates. The Chinese contend that these labour inputs have been effectively substituted for capital in the early stages of development by using either labour-intensive or intermediate technology. But, the evidence also indicates that China may have come close to exhausting the benefits available under past policies - increasing labour inputs, reorganizing the rural sector, bringing marginal land under cultivation, and incrementally improving traditional farming techniques. The growth rate of Chinese agricultural output declined from 6% annually from 1964 to 1968 to around 1.4% per year for the period since 1968. This stagnation raises several crucial policy questions for the Chinese leadership, which are briefly discussed. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Programs found: term specific project ### Topics keywords: chemical fertilizer;DM;CF;contract farming;rural area ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1977,,"Staff Papers Series, Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Minnesota",,,,,,,#37251,,"Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-16 18:29:06)(Screen): seems somewhat relevant, but v old; ",""

Saudi Arabia's HADCO: wheat farmer and more.,"","Abstract: HADCO is one of Saudi Arabia's 6 major national agricultural development companies. Approximately 40% of the company's initial shares are owned by the government, while the remainder belong to Saudi Arabian investors. Such gigantic farms are now supplemented by hundreds of smaller farms owned by private citizens and groups. Almost 350 circles of land (each covering some 52 ha) are watered by centre-pivot irrigators and yield from under 6 t/ha to over 8 t/ha. The HADCO farm was established in 1981 and harvested its first wheat crop in 1983. Production, harvesting, maintenance and marketing activities are outlined. The Saudi government, concerned with the overproduction of wheat, has attempted to encourage farmers to diversify into other crops. HADCO has embarked on a number of new agricultural projects on its farm, made possible by the profits generated by the production of wheat. A brief description is provided of initiatives by HADCO; these include: barley cultivation; sheep farming; a feed mill; poultry rearing; and horticultural projects, among them potato, grape and date production. The farm exemplifies attempts to employ modern agricultural technologies to establish an advanced agricultural sector in the Arabian desert. ### Countries mentioned: Saudi Arabia ### Plant products search: barley;wheat;stone fruits;soft fruits;potatoes ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Programs found: national agricultural (NABS) project;horticultural project;horticulture project;project farmer (PF);agricultural project;agriculture project;agrikultura project ### Topics keywords: animal health;value chain;raw material ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1989,,Agribusiness Worldwide,,,,,,,#36166,,"",""

Seasonal nutritional characteristics of livestock diets in a nomadic pastoral ecosystem.,"","Abstract: Nutrient concn for diets of livestock managed by the Ngisonyoka Turkana in arid NW Kenya were determined throughout 1 annual cycle, using bite-count methods of feeding observation and forage collection and standard procedures for forage chemical analysis. Dietary CP, cell solubles (CS), and in vitro DDM contents were highest for all species during brief wet periods (Apr.-May) and declined variously thereafter, with associated increases in dietary holocellulose and lignin contents. Small-bodied species and/or those that relied heavily on non-herbaceous forage (goats, sheep and camels) typically showed diets with higher CP and CS and lower total fibre (holocellulose + lignin) contents than those of the large grazers (cattle and donkeys). Camel diets were typically the lowest in terms of in vitro DDM content. Evaluation of seasonal diet quality with respect to National Research Council feeding standards for maintenance indicated that potential deficits in dietary N concn were most likely for cattle and least likely for camels during dry periods, and that all diets were consistently deficient in DE content, particularly those of camels. However, patterns of livestock performance observed appear to discount the applicability of feeding standards developed elsewhere. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Programs found: consumer program (CP);community project (CP) ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;cropping system;dry matter;carbon pool;cropping practice;NH4;BMP;agroforestry system;NO3;flow rate;centrifugal pump;land use change;DM;conservation practice;soil organic carbon;management practice;CP;cover crop;crude protein;cropping sequence;carbon stock ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1986,,Journal of Applied Ecology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2307/2404038,,#37164,,"",""
Seed supply constraints in Southern and Eastern Africa.,"","Abstract: Certified seed use in the Southern African Development Community region is largely restricted to maize and cotton. For other crops, the majority of smallholder farmers use farm-saved seed and the use of improved varieties is correspondingly limited. The reasons for low seed sales of improved varieties include high cost (both real and perceived) of seed and associated inputs, and unreliability of returns. More important, administrative or institutional inadequacies (such as public sector monopolies, poor incentives for the private sector, lack of policy attention to ""minor"" crops) limit the production and sale of improved seed. These inadequacies must be resolved through discussions involving both producers and users of seed. In addition, seed regulations (e.g., variety release and certification procedures) are often cumbersome and expensive, and need to be simplified and also harmonized across different countries in the region. Until that is achieved, a transitional arrangement such as the FAO Quality Declared Scheme could be considered. Information exchange is needed among different countries in the region on the performance and potential suitability of imported varieties. Seed certification procedures must be modified to reduce delays and costs, and ensure that quality standards are not excessively strict. These changes could be accelerated by establishing a regional seed fund to finance reviews, seminars and seed networks, and provide support to NGOs, co-operatives, and farmers' groups. ### Plant products search: maize;cotton ### Topics keywords: rural community;public sector;private sector;NGO;contract farming;smallholder farmer;FAO",1997,,"Alternative strategies for smallholder seed supply.

"Selected chemical properties, microbial activity and biomass of soils amended with aqueous neem leaf extract.","","Abstract: With declining fertility levels of soils and the high cost of agricultural inputs, such as commercial fertilizers and pesticides, the use of organic inputs has increased in Zambia. While neem products have been shown to improve soil fertility status, several negative effects on soil organisms have also been cited. The negative effects have been attributed to several secondary metabolites produced by the neem plant. In Zambia, neem leaf extract is applied by small scale farmers to enhance soil fertility and promote crop productivity. This study reports the suitability of aqueous neem leaf extract as a soil amendment and its effect on soil microbial biomass and activity in local soils. Neem leaves were characterized before being used to prepare aqueous neem extract in the concentrations 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20% in water. The extract was characterized for selected mineral components and then applied to 5 kg of soil on a weekly basis for five weeks. Each week, for ten weeks, the effect of the extract on microbial biomass and activity were determined using the Chloroform Fumigation and Incubation (CFI) and soil respiration methods, respectively. Selected soil chemical characteristics were determined at the start and end of the experiment. Results indicated that the chemical composition of the neem leaves was comparable to that observed by others and was similar to that of other tree leaves used for preparing leaf extracts. Amending soils with neem did not significantly improve selected chemical properties but only marginally increased soil calcium levels. Neem leaf extract enhanced soil microbial activity up to 10%, but showed inhibitory effects at 15 and 20% concentrations. Microbial biomass was also depressed by neem leaf extract at 20%. The reduction in both microbial activity and biomass was possibly due to the negative effects of the neem secondary metabolites in the leaf extract at these higher concentrations. Although the application of neem leaf extract at 10% percent or higher can inhibit both microbial biomass and activity, some mineralizable components in the extracts can support growth and activity of some microorganisms in the soil. Based on these results, the application of neem leaf extract at 10% percent or higher can inhibit both microbial biomass and activity and marginally improve soil Ca levels. The use of neem leaf extract can therefore be of benefit to soils with critically low levels of Ca. ### Countries mentioned: Zambia ### Measurements for interventions: microbial activity ### Topics keywords: organic farming;chemical composition;soil fertility;chemical property;microbial biomass;essential oil;factor affecting;bulk density;point view;microbial community;microbial activity;negative effect;small scale;human health;CO2;soil amendment;medicinal plant;organic matter;short term;soil respiration;growing season;factor influencing;secondary metabolite;extension service;sewage sludge;small scale farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2016,,Sustainable Agriculture Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5539/sar.v5n3p103,,#36272,,"",""
Settling the nomads in Wase and Wawa-Zange grazing reserves in the Sudan savannah zone of Nigeria IV: strategies for the control of bovine brucellosis.,"","Abstract: Based on financial losses at present value and incidence of bovine brucellosis, a cost-benefit analysis of two control options was carried out [dates not given]. The two control options considered were extra-hygienic care of infected healthy calving or aborting cattle, and vaccination of heifer calves at 3-6 months of age. The annual financial losses due to bovine brucellosis in the 2 Nigerian grazing reserves (Wase and Wawa-Zange) amounted to 12 706 900.00 naira. The financial losses per 1000 cows were 12 750.90 naira. The cost of avoiding the losses by extra-hygienic measures per 1000 infected calving or aborting cows came to 1 020 000.00 naira, while that by calf vaccination amounted to 751 666.00 naira. The cost-benefit ratio of the 2 options were 0.012 and 16.9 for extra-hygiene measures and vaccination of calves, respectively. It is suggested that as the nomads are fully settled in these reserves, both options are expected to be useful methods of controlling bovine brucellosis. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Sudan ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Measurements for interventions: financial loss ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;animal health;CI ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1998,,Nigerian Veterinary Journal,,,,,,,#37035,,"",""
Short-term preservation of maize landrace seed and taro propagules using indigenous storage methods.,"","Abstract: Some native subsistence farmers in South Africa store maize (Zea mays) cobs over a fireplace and subject the seeds to smoke and heat. Taro (Colocasia esculenta) propagules are maintained in dry pits for one month, in layers separated by grass straw, and water is prevented from contacting them. These methods have been used together with others to maintain landraces for centuries, but they have largely been abandoned with no modern technology replacements. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of the maize and taro storage methods on the quality of planting material. Experiments were conducted on three subsistence farms located in KwaZulu-Natal, and at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Two maize landraces, yellow and white, were subjected to the smoke-over-fire storage method for five months during the normal off-season period for maize production in the location. Control maize seeds were stored in unsealed containers away from fire and smoke. Taro propagules of different sizes (80-100 g corm-1, 40-60 g corm-1 and 20-30 g corm-1) were compared for storability in dry pits, in layers separated by grass straw, for one month. Subsequently, sprouted corms were stored in dry conditions to allow shoot development. During maize seed storage, water content was determined monthly. Maize seed quality was determined by viability, germination and seedling vigour. Sprouting and rooting during taro pit storage, and main shoot development during air storage were used to determine taro propagule performance in storage. Seeds that were stored over fire and smoke showed higher germination and vigour that non-smoked seed. Sprouting and shooting of taro propagules were better in large propagules and the optimum storage depth was 35 to 40 cm. The alpha-amylase activity increased during pit storage and declined to almost the prestorage levels during shoot growth period outside the pits, in all corm sizes. It is concluded that smoke and heat storage improve maize seed quality and pit storage enhances taro propagules by inducing sprouting. Data from this study can be used to investigate the physiological and biochemical basis of seed and propagule quality enhancement, and possibly contribute to technological inventions that are based on indigenous knowledge systems. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil;South Africa ### Plant products search: maize;taro ### Measurements for interventions: corm ### Topics keywords: short term;experiment conducted;plant height;indigenous knowledge;drought stress;planting material;SA;growing season;significant difference;drip irrigation;dry matter;flow rate;sweet potato;medicinal plant ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2004,,South African Journal of Botany,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0254-6299(15)30263-5,,#37494,,"",""

Silvopasture in south-eastern United States: more than just a new name for an old practice.,"","Abstract: In the industrialized world, silvopasture refers to combining trees, forage plants and livestock in an integrated and intensively managed system. Inherent in the concept of modern silvopasture is the emphasis on spatial and temporal domains and integrated management of the system, such that much of the traditional animal grazing in forests and woodland is not considered as silvopasture. Silvopasture is by far the most prevalent agroforestry practice in south-eastern United States, and indeed much of North America, where it is becoming increasingly attractive to non-industrial private forest landowners and livestock operators who want to diversify their enterprise. With increasing public awareness about environmental quality, tree-based systems such as silvopasture are now receiving substantial interest as a new strategy for agroecosystem management. Our recent research results suggest that properly managed silvopasture can enhance water quality by reducing nutrient runoff from heavily fertilized agricultural and dairy enterprises, and improve small farm profitability by providing multiple income sources. Proper procedures need to be developed for valuation of ecosystem services such as water quality enhancement, carbon sequestration and improvement of wildlife habitat provided by silvopasture. Simultaneously, efforts should be taken to institute policy changes that accommodate the value of such benefits. In spite of some location specificity that is inevitable in such studies, our experience on various aspects presented in the chapter will hopefully stimulate silvopastoral research along these lines in other comparable regions as well. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Topics keywords: ecosystem service;point view;soil organic carbon;carbon sequestration;agroforestry system;management practice;pest control;agroforestry practice;sustainable agriculture;long term;agro ecosystem ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2005,,"Silvopastoralism and sustainable land management.

Research on environmental criminal liability,"","Abstract: Translation from original language as provided by authorEnvironment provides the motive force and source for the sustainable development of the mankind, and is the foundation for the subsistence and development of human beings. However, all kinds of environmental problems have emerged when people's ability to remake nature keeps improving with the rapid growth of economy and progress of the society. We have been polluting and destroying the environment while we are benefiting from it. The current environment status is looking blue with the environmental public nuisance events and the three global environmental problems--ozone depletion, greenhouse effect as well as acid rain, which is not only retarding the economic sustainable development, but also threatening human beings' health and life. Our country is one of the developing countries. Due to our relatively backward economy, people's consciousness on environment protection is weak and not enough attention has been give to it. Environmental problem has become one of the serious social problems and how to punish the environment criminal has attracted the most attention in our country. As the last protective barrier in law, the criminal law's most urgent task is how to prevent and punish the environment criminals. In this paper, through analyzing the current research from home and abroad on our country's environmental criminal responsibility, its shortcomings in theory, legislative model, liability principle, implantation and enforcement as well as its difficulty in dealing with the more and more serious environment pollution and resource damage in our country are pointed out. Based on the above knowledge and referring to the experience of the foreign environment criminal responsibility laws, a proposal on making a single environment criminal law and establishing effective law enforcement departments is presented. In addition, suggestion on improving and perfecting our country's environmental criminal responsibility legislation was also brought forward, in which the emphasis was given to innovating the theoretical foundation of the environmental criminal responsibility, developing its principle, comprehensively applying its liability principle as well as rationalizing its implantation in order that the environmental criminal responsibility could have the advanced theoretical foundation, correct principal direction and more accurate liability principle to improve the judicial efficiency and ensure the judicial justice.

"Re-spacing African drylands: territorialization, sedentarization and indigenous commodification in the Ethiopian pastoral frontier.","","Abstract: This paper traces the re-spacing of pastoral drylands in Africa. We argue that rendering pastoral resources legible and profitable occurs both within and beyond the state. Through a multi-sited case study from Ethiopia's Somali region, we excavate different mechanisms of sedentarization, whereby processes of state territorialization and indigenous commodification become mutually entangled. Sedentarization is not imposed by the state or corporate capital, but by indigenous merchants who capture the frontier's potential resource dividend. Land appropriation in the drylands is co-produced by political claims to territory, capital investment and new technopolitics through which indigenous (pastoral, Somali) merchants and politicians become complicit with the state's project of territorialization and sedentarization in a self-governing fashion. The irony of this situation is that the (Ethiopian) state has failed to consolidate sedentarization through planned interventions. Instead, capital investment by local and transnational Somali merchants has opened up a neoliberal frontier that re-spaces drylands towards increasing sedentarization. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia;Somalia ### Programs found: stage project ### Topics keywords: beef cattle;land reform;net return ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2015,,Journal of Peasant Studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2015.1006628,,#37266,,"",""
Reducing Phosphorus Runoff from Dairy Farms [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Phosphorus (P) runoff from manure can lead to eutrophication of surface water and algae growth. This study evaluates the impacts of alternative P reduction practices on dairy farm net returns and on potential P runoff. The P control practices include dairy herd nutrient management, crop nutrient management, and runoff and erosion control. Four farms representative of dairies in the Virginia Shenandoah Valley are simulated including dairies with and without supplementary broiler enterprises and with average and below average land area. A mathematical programming model was developed to predict farm production and net returns and the GLEAMS model was used to predict potential P runoff. The farms are evaluated under four scenarios: Scenario 1, no constraint on P runoff with access to crop nutrient, runoff and erosion control strategies but no access to dairy herd nutrient control strategies; Scenario 2, no constraint on P runoff with access to all crop and dairy herd nutrient control strategies; Scenario 3, constraint on P runoff with access to crop nutrient, runoff and erosion control strategies but no access to dairy herd nutrient control strategies; and Scenario 4, constraint on P runoff with access to all crop and dairy herd nutrient control strategies. Under Scenario 2, the herd nutrient control strategies increase milk output per cow and net returns on both farms and reduce P content of manure and P runoff. Under Scenario 3, limiting P runoff reduces farm returns by 1 and 3% on the average and small farms, respectively. Under Scenario 4, the P runoff constraint is less costly, reducing returns by less than 1% on both farms. Animal nutrient control strategies should be an important part of pollution control policies and programs for livestock intensive watersheds. ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: policy program ### Topics keywords: net return;dairy cow;dairy industry;dairy farm;dairy herd;dairy cattle",2006,,Journal of environmental quality,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND43857317&site=ehost-live,,#36497,,"",""

"Rhamphicarpa fistulosa, a widespread facultative hemi-parasitic weed, threatening rice production in Africa","","Abstract: Rhamphicarpa fistulosa is a facultative hemi-parasitic plant of the Orobanchaceae family, adapted to wet soils. Apart from tropical Australia, it is only found in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is considered a minor weed in cereal crops such as rice. Due to this status, the species has received only sporadic attention. Recent field observations and encounters with rice farmers in several African countries showed that R. fistulosa is, however, a more serious and increasing production constraint than previously thought. Results from a systematic literature review and a global herbarium study support this. The species has a broad distribution over Africa (at least 35 countries from Madagascar to Senegal and from Sudan to South Africa) and a wide range in altitude (0-2150 m a.s.l.) and environment (waterlogged swamps to moist free-draining uplands). Rhamphicarpa fistulosa is relatively independent and persistent because of the presumably wide host range, the facultative nature of its parasitism and its prolific seed (estimated 100 000 seeds m-2 under moderate infestation levels). Finally, R. fistulosa causes severe yield losses (average 60%) and high regional annual economic losses (estimated US $175 million), while effective control options are scant and awareness of the species among important R&amp;D stakeholders is almost absent. An integrated approach is advocated to assist the rice sector to reduce current R. fistulosa-inflicted losses and to prevent further spread of the species into new areas. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan;Madagascar;Australia;Senegal;South Africa ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: drought stress;SSA;SA;human health;pest control;smallholder farmer;wide range ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Weed Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/wre.12129,,#36216,,"",""
Risk and allocative errors due to imperfect information: the impact of wheat technology in Tunisia.,"","Abstract: The study explores the importance and effect of producer uncertainty, risk preferences and imperfect information on wheat production in Tunisia, particularly with respect to the use of modern inputs and the adoption of new varieties. A model is presented which permits the estimation of the risk preferences of agricultural producers. It is hypothesized that, in general, Tunisian wheat producers are risk averse. The model is empirically tested on 125 durum wheat producers during the 1976-77 season. Results indicate that 73% of the farmers sampled are risk averse. Farmers with poor soil and/or small holdings, and who are older tend to be more risk averse than other farmers. This aversion discourages the use of economically optimum levels of modern inputs. ### Countries mentioned: Tunisia ### Plant products search: wheat ### Measurements for crops: wheat ### Topics keywords: crop insurance;contract farming;CAP ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1980,,"Dissertation Abstracts International, A",,,,,,,#37060,,"",""
Significant build-up of soil organic carbon under climate-smart conservation farming in Sub-Saharan Acrisols,"","Abstract: Conservation farming (CF) involving minimumtillage, mulching and crop rotation may offer climate change adaptation and mitigation benefits. However, reported effects of CF, as applied by smallholders, on storage of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa differ considerably between studies. This is partly due to differences in management practice, soil type and adoption level between individual farmers. Where CF involves planting basins, year-to-year changes in position of basins make SOC stock estimates more uncertain. Here we assess the difference in SOC build-up and soil quality between inside planting basins (receiving inputs of lime and fertilizer; basins opened each year) and outside planting basins (no soil disturbance or inputs other than residues) under hand-hoe tilled CF in an Acrisol at Mkushi, Zambia. Seven years of strict CF husbandry significantly improved soil quality inside planting basins as compared with outside basins. Significant effects were found for SOC concentration (0.74 +/- 0.06% vs. 0.57 +/- 0.08%), SOC stock (20.1 +/- 2.0 vs. 16.4 +/- 2.6 t ha(-1), 0-20 cm), soil pH (6.3 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.4) and cation exchange capacity (3.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.4 cmol ### Countries mentioned: Zambia ### Plant products search: citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: minimum tillage;CEC;EC;CA;soil fertility;rural community;carbon footprint;contract farming;DOC;GHG emission;bulk density;chemical fertilizer;SSA;CF;MT;NT;crop rotation;DM;cation exchange capacity;LCA;soil organic carbon;OC;climate change adaptation;organic matter;management practice;cover crop;climate change;organic carbon;smallholder farmer;CC ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2019,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.452,,#36199,,"",""
Singapore's environment and food production,"","Abstract: Most recent figures from Singapore's Primary Production Department show that the country now produces less than 10% of its own food. This compares with 40% of its own water supply, hitherto considered to be Singapore's Achilles Heel. Although the Republic's agrotechnology programme has been in existence since 1986, it appears to be lagging behind demand; so can anything be done to increase production and at the same time improve the environment? This paper examines the recent history of Singapore's agricultural policy and compares it with the 'traditional' family farms which are still being phased out. It considers that family farms, agricultural allotments and even flat roof tops, could be both economically productive and of great advantage to the environment because of recreational and ecological benefits. The conclusion is that there is a place for both traditional farmland as well as advanced food growing technology in Singapore. ### Countries mentioned: Singapore ### Programs found: agrotechnology program;agroecology program ### Measurements for interventions: water supply ### Topics keywords: point view;plant height;taking account ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1997,,Environmental Monitoring and Assessment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005743316232,,#37579,,"",""
"Site selection and production performance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) cage operations in small farm reservoirs: The Western Cape experience, South Africa","","Abstract: Cage farming of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has expanded rapidly into private farm reservoirs of the Western Cape. During the grow-out season 2006, water quality problems such as increased mortality rates and off-flavour of the final product caused economic losses. To set criteria for improved site selection, water quality information of surface and near-bottom water was correlated with morphometric reservoir data, fish production data as well as the observed production difficulties. The data revealed good linkage between reservoir information and fish production data as well as production problems. The production problems correlated (P1 per year) to avoid oxygen problems. Reservoirs of larger surface area (>5 ha) produced significantly larger fish that grew faster and showed lower mortality rates. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Animal products search: fish ### Measurements for interventions: water quality ### Topics keywords: chemical composition;drought stress;SA;final product;raw material ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2008,,Aquaculture Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02054.x,,#36292,,"",""
Site-specific fertilizer recommendations for oil palm smallholders using information from large plantations.,"","Abstract: Provision of appropriate fertilizer recommendations to smallholder farmers is becoming increasingly important, for reasons of food security, economic viability, and the need to maintain soil fertility. Oil palm is one of the most important crops in the humid tropics, but smallholder growers (&lt;10 ha) typically have low yields, largely due to inadequate fertilizer inputs and/or incomplete harvesting. It is difficult to produce appropriate fertilizer recommendations for the smallholder growers, due to their large numbers and small farm sizes. In this work, we developed a way of transferring to smallholder growers the fertilizer recommendations that have been developed for nearby plantation fields using large fertilizer trials. The study site was in West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea, and transfer of information was done using a geographic information system and maps of plantation fields, smallholder blocks, and soil types. The soil-map-unit descriptions were interpreted, and a unified classification system was derived. Then, fertilizer recommendations that had been made on a field-specific basis for the large plantations were allocated to soil types and thereby to individual smallholder blocks. In this way, block-specific fertilizer recommendations were made for more than 4000 individual smallholders. The procedures used were developed into a conceptual framework which is transferable to other regions. Recommendations can be updated as new information becomes available on smallholder block locations or plantation fertilizer recommendations. ### Countries mentioned: Guinea;United States;Guinea-Bissau;Papua New Guinea ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;precision agriculture;site specific;soil fertility;oil palm;geographic information system;geographical information system;using geographic information;farm size;smallholder farmer;GIS;management practice;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Journal of Plant Nutrition and Soil Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/jpln.201000178,,#36726,,"",""

Selected quantitative effects of ÖPUL.,"","Abstract: A model analysis is carried out of the income, output and environmental effects of ÖPUL (Austrian support to farmers for environmental measures) payments to improve ground water quality. The ÖPUL aims are to maintain a adequate farm income, reduce output and improve environmental quality. Income is hard to measure because of the possibility of including non-farm income, with output the problem is that reduced yields may be balanced by extending area and problems can also arise with measuring exact improvements in groundwater quality. A model taking account of these limitation compares yields of winter wheat on two types of soils for the years 1989-1998 with extensive and conventional production methods. Over the period 1995-1998, after the introduction of the ÖPUL measures, yield differences averaged 8.6% on the good soils and 6.2% on the poor. ### Countries mentioned: Austria ### Plant products search: winter wheat;wheat ### Topics keywords: winter wheat;NDVI;taking account ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2000,,Förderungsdienst,,,,,,,#37253,,"",""
Self-sufficiency in food-some fundamental requirements.,"","Abstract: The author, a member of the National Planning Council (Planning Commission), reviews the various post-war food policy measures undertaken by the Government of India and indicates their limitations. A long-term view should be taken of the food problem and agricultural production as a whole and nothing done which would in any way prejudice large-scale and lasting developments. The major drawback in food production is lack of irrigation facilities. In most of the country such cultivation provides a bare subsistence for the farmers and output is small and uncertain. The farmer is therefore reluctant to increase his working expenses, whether for improved seeds, fertilizers or better methods. Steps should be taken to deal with all problems relating to irrigation on a functional basis. The sooner the organizational set-up is orientated to give due attention to all these in an integrated and scientific manner, the earlier can the country look forward to a solution of its food and agricultural problems.

Sheep and goat milk in pastoral societies [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Approximately 25% of the world's land surface supports about 20 million pastoral households or about 180-200 million people. Pastoral societies raise livestock often under extreme, extensive conditions on marginal rangelands that cannot be cultivated or used for other agricultural purposes. The animals provide the owners with milk, meat, wool/hair, leather and dung and, in addition, can be used as a source of cash, for transport and as pack animals. In most systems, several species of livestock are shepherded by pastoralists with sheep and goats being the most common and widespread. Traditionally, in pastoral systems in which sheep and goats were shepherded with cattle, cows were the main source of milk; when shepherded with camels, she-camels were the main source of milk; and when shepherded with yaks, naks were the main source of milk. Today, in general, the ratio of sheep and goats to other livestock is increasing, as is the ratio of milk produced by sheep and goats to other livestock. Sheep and goats raised by pastoralists are generally low-producing in terms of milk and offspring but are well-adapted to the climatic conditions and are relatively tolerant of local diseases. Goats generally produce more milk and have a longer lactation period than sheep, but sheep milk has higher fat and total solid contents than goat milk. Sheep produce about 40-60 kg of milk per lactation and goats up to 100 kg. In some areas, these small ruminants are particularly important for milk during the dry season and during droughts. Milk provides valuable products for pastoralists: butter and yoghurt for immediate consumption and storable ghee and dried curds for later use. ### Animal products search: meat;goat milk;yogurt;sheep milk ### Topics keywords: small ruminant;sweet potato;TS;winter wheat;taking account;dry season;agroforestry system;farming system;long term;small scale;anaerobic digestion;climatic condition;dairy cattle;animal health;animal husbandry;food insecurity;spatial distribution;growing season;crop residue;human activity",2007,,Small ruminant research,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND43885613&site=ehost-live,,#37055,,"",""
Seasonality in poverty level of rural farming households in Oyo State Nigeria.,"","Abstract: The study examined poverty level among farmers in rural areas of Oyo State, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was used in collecting data from 180 farming households during the rainy and dry season. The analysis shows that the incidence of poverty is 32.7% and 40.6% during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Poverty rate is higher among older farmers with low level of education who are subsistence farmers with large members and who had no access to food preparation and modern faming technology. Poverty indices are higher during dry season than rainy season. To reduce poverty among farmers, farming households should be targeted with education, birth-control programmes, time saving technology and cash transfer programs to bridge the dry season consumption deficit. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Programs found: control program (CCP);cash transfer (CT) program ### Measurements for interventions: farming household ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity;rural area ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,Journal of Agricultural and Biological Science,,,,,,,#37485,,"",""
Sediment transport capacity and its response to hydraulic parameters in experimental rill flow on steep slope,"","Abstract: Sediment transport capacity must be considered when developing physical models of soil erosion. The effects of related hydraulic parameters (e.g., flow discharge, slope gradient, and flow velocity), and of force predictors (e.g., shear stress, stream power, and unit stream power) on sediment transport capacity in rill erosion are still poorly known on the farmland of the Loess Plateau in China where rill erosion is common. We conducted a series of experiments to simulate and evaluate the sediment transport capacity of rill flow in a nonerodible rill flume. The test sediment was the loessial soil of the farmland of the Loess Plateau. Five flow discharges ranging from 0.22 to 0.67 × 10-3 m2 s-1 (0.00237 to 0.00721 ft2 sec-1) and five slope gradients ranging from 15.8% to 38.4% were tested. Sediment transport capacity increased with both flow discharge and slope gradient, as expected, but was more sensitive to flow discharge than to slope gradient, unlike other similar studies. Mean flow velocity, related to the flow discharge, was strongly correlated with sediment transport capacity (r2 = 0.93). Stream power was the best predictor of sediment transport capacity; shear stress and unit stream power, with critical values of 0.55 W m-2 and 0.02 m s-1 (0.04 mi hr-1) respectively, were poor predictors. An empirical equation of sediment transport capacity of the loessial soil for rill flow was developed. Our results present a different view, compared to previous studies, of the relationship of sediment transport capacity with discharge and slopes, especially with lower discharges, steep slopes, and loessial soil. Further study should be conducted to evaluate the performance of farmland soil at various slopes and discharges. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;sediment transport;bulk density;flow rate ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2015,,Journal of Soil and Water Conservation,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2489/jswc.70.1.36,,#36965,,"",""
Small farm dams: A ticking time bomb?,"","Abstract: Many of South Africa's small farm dams have become mere sediment traps endangering the nation's larger storage reservoirs. The longest monitored sediment yield record in South Africa is from the lower Orange River. The data presented point to small farm dams in badly eroded dry-land areas playing a significant role in trapping sediment. Many of these dams are now full and have lost their trapping capacity, while others have breached and are beginning to lose their sediment to the downstream system. Where documentary evidence has provided the age of dam construction or re-construction, by coring at several points in the reservoirs the project team has been able to estimate the volume of stored sediment. Estimates of dam trap efficiency have continued to be a challenge, especially at Cranemere where the dam wall has been raised on at least three occasions since it was first built in the 1840s. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: citrus fruits ### Programs found: reservoir project ### Topics keywords: SA;environmental impact;human activity;drought stress ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2009,,Water Wheel,,,,,,,#37262,,"",Observational
Small grain export potential and government objectives in Zimbabwe: a mean-ends inconsistency?,"","Abstract: Zimbabwe's potential for small grain exports is examined in the context of the government's stated policy objectives. Since attaining independence in 1980, the government of Zimbabwe has committed itself to improving the income and productivity of smallholders. A number of policy measures were implemented which have resulted in substantial grain production and hence increased offers to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB). A shortage of demand for small grains has, however, resulted in a decline in producer prices and the level of GMB operations. This rapid small grain production is observed to have largely by-passed the dryland areas of Zimbabwe. The paper considers Zimbabwe's ability to produce a reliable exportable surplus of small grains, the potential beneficiaries of small grain marketing and the price incentives necessary to induce an exportable surplus. An attempt is also made to examine the potential magnitude and reliability of import demand within the SADCC region. It is suggested that the policy of deliberate investment in small grain export capacity is inconsistent with the aim of increasing income among dryland smallholders and an efficient generation of foreign exchange. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: grain ### Topics keywords: contract farming;factor influencing;developing country ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",1990,,"Working Paper - Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension, University of Zimbabwe",,,,,,,#36887,,"",Observational
Smallholder Adaptation to Drought in Costa Rica's Crony Capitalist Rice Economy,"","Abstract: This article advances theoretical understanding of exclusionary politics in rural locations through an institutional analysis of adaptation to climate change in Costa Rica's rice economy. It describes how crony capitalism evolved in state-sponsored rural development as the national economy moved towards a new neoliberal model. Cronies reorganized rice production and re-appropriated capital flows. As smallholder farmers were marginalized in the rice economy, their reliance on the state for irrigation water made them vulnerable to drought. As the state adapted its water allocation scheme to drought conditions, it determined who would profit and who would lose their livelihood. The authors use this analysis to argue that climate change adaptation is a normative process that may be used to justify coercion and control of specific classes of people. To understand this process, current adaptation frames must be broadened to include the organization of production and the appropriation and realization of capital flows. This broadening facilitates an understanding of how climate change adaptation strategies produce stratified class structures; some classes are made vulnerable to climate change while others profit. Breaking with the common refrain in much of the critical literature on neoliberal development, the authors argue that state responses to neoliberal change--not just neoliberal change itself--must be increasingly incorporated into critical development studies of rural transformations. ### Countries mentioned: Costa Rica ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;adaptation strategy;rural community;adaptation climate change;rural development;smallholder farmer;climate change adaptation;CC ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2018,,Development and Change,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1757730&site=ehost-live,,#36255,,"",Observational
Smallholder agroprocessors' willingness to pay for value-added solid-waste management solutions,"","Abstract: The paper examined the willingness of smallholder cassava processors to pay for value-added solid wastes management solutions in Nigeria. We employed a multistage sampling procedure to obtain primary data from 403 cassava processors from the forest and Guinea savannah zones of Nigeria. Contingent valuation and logistic regression were used to determine the willingness of the processors to pay for improved waste management options and the factors influencing their decision on the type of waste management system adopted and willingness to pay for a value-added solid-waste management system option. Women constituted the largest population of smallholder cassava processors, and the processors generated a lot of solid waste (605-878 kg/processor/season). Waste was usually dumped (59.6%), given to others (58.1%), or sold in wet (27.8%) or dry (35.5%) forms. The factors influencing the processors' decision on the type of waste management system to adopt included sex of processors, membership of an association, quantity of cassava processed and ownership structure. Whereas the processors were willing to pay for new training on improved waste management technologies, they were not willing to pay more than US$3. However, US$3 may be paid for training in mushroom production. It is expected that public expenditure on training to empower processors to use solid-waste conversion technologies for generating value-added products will lead to such social benefits as lower exposure to environmental toxins from the air, rivers and underground water, among others, and additional income for the smallholder processors. The output of the study can serve as the basis for developing usable and affordable solid-waste management systems for community cassava processing units in African countries involved in cassava production. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Guinea;Guinea-Bissau ### Plant products search: mushrooms;cassava ### Measurements for interventions: cassava processor ### Topics keywords: agro food;value chain;willing pay;contingent valuation;special issue;willingness pay;value added;factor influencing;WTP;among others ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2019,,Sustainability (Switzerland),,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061759,,#36530,,"",""
"Smallholder Farmer Adoption of Climate-Related Adaptation Strategies: The Importance of Vulnerability Context, Livelihood Assets, and Climate Perceptions","","Abstract: Despite increased research characterizing the adaptive capacity of households and communities, there are few empirical studies that test why farmers adopt costly climate-related adaptive strategies, which strategies are implemented, and farmers' perceptions of climate changes. In this study, we analyzed determinants for smallholder farmer adoption of adaptation strategies in Chiapas, Mexico. We conducted 291 surveys with landowners in eight coffee farming communities. Farmers were asked which of 21 adaptation strategies they had engaged in, within five categories: migration, storage, land use diversification, community investment, and market exchange. We found the most frequent strategies included planting shade coffee, diversifying crop varieties, shifting sow date, building living walls, reforesting, or engaging in soil conservation. Although many farmers have experienced natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes, they were most concerned by long-term threats to crops like coffee rust and higher temperatures, that require costly adaptive investments. We find farmers adapt to climate events because of their vulnerability context (i.e., experience with disasters and distance to markets). Land holdings (i.e., natural capital), farm equipment (i.e., physical capital), and group membership (i.e., social capital), were also key factors influencing adaptation. Finally, farmers with strong perceptions of drought and temperature change were most likely to adapt. These results suggest policy makers should have a multi-pronged approach to: improve farmers' resource base through explicitly promoting adaptation strategies like crop and income diversification; inform climate perceptions through workshops on climate and weather; and strengthen participation in community and producer organizations to increase smallholder adaptation. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: natural resource;adaptation strategy;land degradation;willingness pay;contract farming;adaptive capacity;long term;policy maker;natural capital;farmer perception;natural disaster;decision making;social capital;management practice;cover crop;climate change;crop insurance;land use;factor influencing;extension service;smallholder farmer;CC ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2019,,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-019-01152-z,,#37179,,"",""
"Smallholder farmer’s perceived effects of climate change on crop production and household livelihoods in rural Limpopo province, South Africa","","Abstract: This study investigated the perceived effects of climate change on crop production and household livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Mopani and Vhembe district, South Africa. Data was collected through a questionnaire administered to 150 smallholder farmers. The questionnaires were complemented by 8 focus group discussions and secondary data. Multinomial logit regression model was used to analyse the factors influencing smallholder farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation strategies. The study findings revealed that subsistence farmers perceived prolonged droughts (56.4%) as the main shock stressing crop production. Droughts often lead to low crop yield and high crop failure (73.3%). In response to the prevailing climatic conditions different gender adopted different strategies, 41% of female farmers adapted by changing planting dates, while male farmers employed crop variety and diversification (35%) and mixed cropping (15%). The smallholder farmers were vulnerable with limited adaptive capacity to withstand climate change due to compromised social, human, physical, natural and financial assets. The results showed that smallholder farmers tend to adapt better when they have access to extension officers (P<0.01). Therefore, it is important for the government to strengthen the relationship between smallholder farmers and extension officers for better climate change adaptation. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;adaptation strategy;drought stress;winter wheat;rural community;climate change adaptation;growing season;SA;adaptation climate change;climatic condition;taking account;factor influencing;smallholder farmer;social capital;CC;long term;adaptive capacity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,Change and Adaptation in Socio-Ecological Systems,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND605678666&site=ehost-live,,#36520,,"",""

Therefore this study was designed to understand the existing M&amp;E and how it can be improved and strengthened to become more responsive to the needs of the small-scale farmers and embrace diverse stakeholder participation and social learning. The results indicate that there is no consistent monitoring and evaluation that is either done at Institute, Programme or Community levels. They also indicate that the two programmes rarely incorporate monitoring and evaluation component at the time of project design. In addition, most scientists perceive monitoring and evaluation as a responsibility of donor consultants that assess the project to find out whether their funds have been well utilised and the outlined outputs achieved. The indicators used in the existing monitoring and evaluation are developed without wider and key stakeholder participation. The criteria of selecting the stakeholder organizations and individuals that participate in monitoring forums is also not clear and wanting, with clear biases that reflect power structure and power relations. Therefore, there is a need to improve and strengthen the existing M&amp;E in NARS for it to be more participatory and responsive to the grassroots realities. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Kenya ### Plant products search: maize ### Programs found: agricultural research institute (ARI) program;time project ### Topics keywords: small scale;rural household;rural poverty;extension service;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2007,,"8th African Crop Science Society Conference, El-Minia, Egypt, 27-31 October 2007",,,,,,,#37594,,"",""
"Soil carbon sequestration, carbon markets, and conservation agriculture practices: A hypothetical examination in Mozambique","","Abstract: Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are relatively novel mechanisms whereby the adoption of sustainable management practices by a stakeholder is rewarded by incentives linked to external markets. Adoption of PES for conservation agricultural practices (CAPS) by smallholder farmers may provide opportunities to increase household income or cover the technology costs of adoption if the carbon sequestration benefits of CAPS are quantifiable, adoption rates are accelerated and maintained, a mechanism exists whereby carbon sequestration services can be compensated, and carbon offset exchange markets are viable. This research suggests a methodology to examine a PES market for carbon offsets generated by the adoption of CAPS by farmers in Mozambique. Assuming a cumulative adoption of 60% over a 20-year period, revenue from PES market participation to CA adopters was two times higher than revenue earned when disadoption occurred midway through the simulation. Lower adoption targets are associated with higher per household returns when fertilizer rates typical to the region are increased. Establishing and maintaining a sustainable PES system in the study region would require significant investment in time and resources. The lack of on-the-ground institutions or local support for such a program would also challenge successful implementation. Finally, the programs where participant success depends on external markets, such as the hypothetical one suggested here, are subject to the ebb and flow of foreign demand for carbon offsets. Addressing these three broad constraints to a PES/CAPS program in the region would require grass-roots driven policy initiatives with buy-in at multiple social, economic, and political levels. ### Countries mentioned: Mozambique ### Programs found: support program;conservation agriculture production system (CAPS) program;local support program;policy initiative;common agricultural policy (CAP) program;grass root driven policy initiative ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;ecosystem service;spatial distribution;trace element;CA;cluster analysis;rural household;soil organic carbon;carbon sequestration;household income;agroforestry system;smallholder farmer;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2017,,International Soil and Water Conservation Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iswcr.2017.06.001,,#36219,,"",""
Soil fertility status and potential organic inputs for improving small holder crop production in the interior savanna zone of Ghana,"","Abstract: Soil fertility decline is a major problem facing small-scale farming in Sub-Saharan Africa. To optimize the productivity of fertilizer usage, it is imperative that the fertility status of the soil is known. This study was conducted to evaluate the fertility status and potential organic inputs that can be used alone or in combination with mineral fertilizers for increased crop production in the interior savanna zone of Ghana. A survey of the availability of potential organic inputs in the region identified cow dung, refuse compost, and some plant residues with potential for enhancing soil productivity. Soil, household refuse, cow dung, and plant samples were collected from 40 farming communities and analyzed using standard protocols. The decomposition and nutrient release patterns of the organic materials were further investigated in laboratory incubation studies and in litter bags for 12 weeks. Results of the physico-chemical analysis revealed that soils in the interior savanna zone are coarse textured with low exchange capacity. The majority of the soils have low organic matter contents (1.0 ±0.4%) and low levels of the major plant nutrients. Available P in particular was very low with most of the soils having values less than 5.0 ppm. Elemental analysis of the materials revealed that they contained appreciable quantities of macro and micronutrients. The N contents of all the plant materials were higher than the critical level of 20.0-25.0 mg g-1 below which net N immobilization from the soil would be expected. The P contents of all the materials were above the critical level of 2.5 mg g-1 for P mineralization. The C/N ratios of all the materials were below 25, which indicate rapid mineral N release during decomposition. The decomposition of the materials indicated the high potential of the materials to supply NPK to crop plants within the experimental period. This suggests that the application of these materials to soil alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer ould improve nutrient availability to crop plants. Since results obtained may differ under field condition where mineralization tends to be complicated by environmental factors, field studies using a test crop such as maize are recommended to establish the relationship between nutrient release from the materials and crop demand. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Plant products search: maize ### Measurements for interventions: plant material;organic matter ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;EC;soil fertility;drinking water;NPK;bulk density;SSA;NH4;sample collected;NO3;small scale;crop rotation;NP;DDT;DM;heavy metal;organic matter;food security;organic fertilizer;spatial distribution;trace element;organic matter content;OM;mineral fertilizer;sewage sludge;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2005,,Journal of Sustainable Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1300/J064v25n04_07,,#37616,,"",""
Soil management and soil properties in a Kenyan smallholder irrigation system on naturally low-fertile soils,"","Abstract: In this study we examine the impact of soil management practices on soil properties in a landscape with naturally relatively poor soils on and below the dry slopes of a Rift Valley escarpment in Kenya that have been dominated by extensive smallholder investments in canal irrigation over the last 300 years. We show that farmers in the area have been able to keep up agricultural production in the face of growing population. The actual practices of soil management at one moment in time appear to be of minor importance to soil improvement, as indicated by the low correlation between Soil Management Index (SMI) and soil chemical data. However, cultivation triggers a process of slow soil improvement manifested by a positive correlation between nutrient levels and duration of irrigated cultivation and soil management, which likely explains farmers’ confidence in soil productivity. However, we also identify sodicity as a risk connected to intensified irrigation in the area. Finally, we stress the need for further studies integrating investigations of local irrigation and soil management with soil and water quality analyses. These will be crucial to shape sustainable place-based and farmer-led solutions for African agricultural growth. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: soil fertility;plant height;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2018,,Applied Geography,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.12.008,,#36807,,"",""
Soil quality and soil productivity in Africa,"","Abstract: More than four decades of research and development work in Africa have not resulted in the 3-5% annual increase in agricultural growth necessary for most African countries to ensure sustainability of agriculture and the promise of food security in the next decade. The present study evaluates the quality of the soil resource base of Africa and also the risks to sustainable agriculture and soil productivity on a continent-wide basis. Fifty-five percent of the land in Africa is unsuitable for any kind of agriculture except nomadic grazing. These are largely the deserts, which includes salt flats, dune and rock lands, and the steep to very steep lands. Though these lands have constraints to sustainability, about 30% of the population or about 250 million people are living, or are dependent on these land resources. About 16% of the land has soils of high quality and about 13% has soils of medium quality. This 9 million km2 of land in Africa currently supports about 400 million or about 45% of the people. There are compelling reasons for African nations to return to fundamentals in terms of research and developmental initiatives. Those countries with subsistence agriculture have had minimal inputs in acquiring and managing information about their resource conditions. The green revolution succeeded in Asia in those countries where there was a serious effort to match technology with resource conditions and where advances in development and use of high-yielding cultivars was accompanied by appropriate soil, water, and nutrient management. ### Programs found: developmental initiative ### Topics keywords: green revolution;drought stress;chemical fertilizer;SA;sustainable agriculture;food security",1997,,Journal of Sustainable Agriculture,,,,,,,#36892,,"",""
"Soil quality - concepts, methods of assessment and strategies for improvement.","","Abstract: Subsistence agriculture under rainfed conditions and declining or stagnant yields on irrigated lands are serious challenges for the country's food security. Among several other causes, land degradation and deteriorating soil quality are considered as important hurdles in breaking the yield barriers. Reversal of land degradation and restoring back the quality of soil to the original level is rather a very difficult task. In order to have timely corrections, it is essential to assess the periodical changes in soil quality as influenced by long-term crop husbandry and soil management practices. There are several approaches to interpret the soil test data to arrive at certain conclusions about the status of soil quality and to make recommendations about the suitable measures for correcting it. As the soil tests are expensive and time-consuming, these tests cannot be taken up by the farmers for all the physical, chemical and biological soil properties periodically. Hence, the key indicator approach which considers only the important representative soil properties identified using various data redundancy steps has been found to be very effective and useful tool to assess soil quality. After the identification of key indicators and computation of integrated soil quality indices (SQI) for a given situation, appropriate soil-crop management practices are suggested. This paper deals comprehensively with concepts of soil quality, various approaches to assess soil quality, importance of soil quality indicators and strategies to improve soil quality on long-term basis. ### Topics keywords: land degradation;LD;long term;management practice;food security",2017,,Indian Journal of Fertilisers,,,,,,,#36615,,"",""
Somali Democratic Republic national tsetse and trypanosomiasis control project land use survey: resource development in the Shabeelle Valley.,"","Abstract: This report describes some priorities and possibilities for the development of agriculture, livestock production and rangelands in the Shabeelle Valley following tsetse eradication. Tsetse eradication is not, however, a prerequisite of most of these developments, though it would allow the intensification of livestock production and rangeland use in high potential riverine areas if other constraints could be overcome. Outline proposals are presented for the rehabilitation of irrigation in the middle Shabeelle Valley and for swamp drainage in the lower Shabeelle. For the development of agriculture and livestock production, the expansion and improvement of research and extension services is seen as a priority. Recommendations are made for research activities directed towards the greater understanding of whole farm systems, the greater integration of livestock in the farming system, and intensification of livestock production (particularly through the development of forage crops and milk production). Proposals are also made for an approach to pastoral development and rangeland improvement; the specific requirements of different parts of the Shabeelle Valley are discussed. Finally, recommendations are made for further detailed land resource, land capability, climate, hydrometry and topographical surveys necessary for project planning, and for land use planning services to facilitate the preparation and coordination of land development policies and programmes. ### Countries mentioned: Somalia ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: policy program;control project ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;animal welfare;natural resource;dairy farming;livestock farming;land use;point view;land use planning;extension service;crop residue;animal health;GIS;farming system;beef cattle ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1985,,"LRDC Report, Land Resources Development Centre, Overseas Development Adminstration, UK",,,,,,,#37347,,"",""

South Africa. Agricultural and Pastoral Production.,"","Abstract: Preliminary statistics place agriculture's contribution to the net domestic product during the 1965/66 season at .R636 million, an increase of R54-3 million over the 1964/65 contribution. This improvement was primarily due to a record wool clip and substantially improved citrus and deciduous fruit harvests. The wool clip for 1965/66 totalled 326-9 million lb., valued at RlOO-2 million. Wool remains the major agricultural export, and the average export price for 1965/66 was slightly higher than in the previous season. The total value of wool exports for 1965/66 amounted to R125-1 million and reflected an increase of R17-8 million, or 16-5 per cent., on the figure recorded for 1964/65. Between January and October, 10-3 million cases of citrus fruit were exported compared with 9-9 million cases during the same period of 1965. In April, the marketing of all citrus fruit became a monopoly of the Citrus Board, thus permitting the most economical and equitable distribution of supplies and preventing surpluses from arising during the in-season period. The 1965/66 season's output of deciduous fruit exceeded all previous records. The 1965/66 season saw a total production of 266, 013 tons of deciduous fruit, which, in spite of the drought in various parts of the country, reflects a record increase of 47, 387 tons on the output for the 1964/65 season. Deciduous fruit exports rose by 29 per cent, during the 1965/66 season. During the first 10 months of 1966 exports of all products (excluding gold) totalled R974-5 million, of which R212-5 million was contributed by agricultural commodities. Damage wrought by drought in previous years necessitated substantial imports of maize and dairy products. The Maize Board arranged for the import of approximately 2-2 million bags of maize in order to safeguard the stock position. Other agricultural imports of significance during the year included rice and wheat. The 1965/66 maize yield amounted to 49.5 million bags-an increase on the 47-2 million bags produced during the 1964/65 season. Continually increasing domestic consumption once more lowered the quantity of maize and maize products available for export. Production by the sugar industry up to October 1 amounted to 925, 301 short tons, or an increase of 356, 384 short tons on the quantity produced in the corresponding period of 1965. The year 1966 saw important strides in agricultural rehabilitation of the land. In August 1966 the Agricultural Credit Bill was passed by Parliament providing for financial assistance to farmers in an attempt to turn uneconomic units into economically productive farms. The State Conservation Service completed almost R4 million worth of land-reclamation works in 1966. Subsidization for the complete withdrawal of stock from exhausted veld has been introduced in severely denuded areas. The 1966 agricultural scene was more buoyant than during 1965, as evidenced by the rise in food prices. Towards the end of the year good summer rains broke the drought in many parts of the country, improving the production prospects for maize, wool and sugar in particular. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: maize;rice;wheat;citrus fruits ### Measurements for crops: maize ### Topics keywords: arable land;drought stress;SA;sugar beet;sugar industry;land reclamation ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1967,,"Overseas Surveys, Barclays Bank, D.C.O.",,,,,,,#36222,,"",""
Spatial and temporal variations in nitrogen export from a New Zealand pastoral catchment revealed by stream water nitrate isotopic composition.,"","Abstract: Viable indicators of nitrogen (N) attenuation at the catchment scale are needed in order to sustainably manage global agricultural intensification. We hypothesized that the dominance of a single land use (pasture production) and strong ground-to-surface water connectivity would combine to create a system in which surface water nitrate isotopes (δN and δO of NO) could be used to monitor variations in catchment-scale attenuation. Nitrate isotopes were measured monthly over a 2 year period in four reaches along a spring-fed, gaining stream (mean NO-N of 6 mg L) in Canterbury, New Zealand. The stream water NO pool indicated that the highest degree of denitrification occurred in the shallow upper reaches. Moving downstream through increasingly sandy soils, the isotopic signature of denitrification became progressively weaker. The lowest reaches fell into the expected range for NO produced from the nitrification of pasture N sources (urine and fertilizers), implying that the attenuation capacity of the groundwater and riparian systems was lower than the rate of N inputs. After excluding months affected by effluent spills or extreme weather (=4), variations in the degree of denitrification over stream distance were combined with the measured NO discharge to estimate N attenuation over time in the subcatchment. Attenuation was highly responsive to rainfall: 93% of calculated attenuation (20 kg NO-N ha yr) occurred within 48 h of rainfall. These findings demonstrate the potential for detailed NO stable isotope data to provide integrative measures of catchment NO loss pathways. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand;United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: land use change;land use;specie richness;NH4;NO3;agricultural intensification ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2016,,Water Resources Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017642,,#37142,,"",""
"Spatial variability of selected soil micronutrients under smallholder crop production in Zanyokwe, Eastern Cape, South Africa.","","Abstract: Understanding spatial variability of soil nutrients, including that of micronutrients, is important for establishing best management practices in smallholder crop production. The objective of this study was to determine the status and spatial variability of potentially available zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) for selective management at Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme. Soil samples were collected from the 0-20 cm depth on 50 m × 50 m grids and coordinates of the sampling points were recorded using a global positioning system (GPS). The samples were analysed for Zn, Cu, Mn and Fe after extraction with EDTA. The GPS coordinates and corresponding micronutrient values were interpolated using simple kriging to produce continuous raster surfaces, which were then reclassified, using prescribed limits, to produce soil micronutrient maps. Zinc was deficient and exhibited the highest spatial variability, within short distances. There was limited spatial variability of Cu, Mn and Fe. The study highlighted the need for the creation of management zones for Zn availability. Field studies are recommended to establish the extent to which Zn is limiting yields and nutritional quality of crops grown at the scheme. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: EC;drought stress;water saving;SA;agricultural machinery;drinking water;bulk density;BMP;sample collected;precision agriculture;small scale;DDT;heavy metal;irrigation scheme;spatial variability;management practice;spatial distribution;GPS;trace element;best management practice;GIS ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,South African Journal of Plant and Soil,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/02571862.2016.1266399,,#37298,,"",""
"Spatial variability of soil pH and phosphorus in relation to soil run-off following slash-and-burn land clearing in Sumatra, Indonesia","","Abstract: Slash-and-burn land clearing on sloping land may lead to increased soil run-off following disappearance of the protective vegetative cover. In turn, soil run-off and redeposition affects soil fertility and spatial patterns of fertility parameters in a field. This study seeks to clarify the role of spatial patterns of post-burn dead biomass (necromass) in soil run-off and redeposition and their combined effect on spatial patterns in soil pH and resin-extractable P. The study is carried out on a post-productive rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. Soils are classified as Dystric Fluvisols. After slash-and-burn of vegetation, the field was planted with rubber seedlings and rice (Oryza sativa). For comparison the adjacent rubber agroforest site was sampled. Soil run-off is expressed here as the quantity of downward moving soil that passed the specific location of a flow trap. Existing physical soil run-off barriers and crop performance were scored. Despite serious soil run-off from the steeper upper slopes little soil was actually lost because of the slope form of the field, presence of natural soil run-off barriers, and the planted crop. Spatial variability of soil pH decreased at the expense of small-scale, within-strata, variability mainly because of the patchy distribution of soil run-off barriers. Soil run-off, aggravated by slash-and-burn, did not result in development of a clear soil fertility gradient down slope. In areas of high soil run-off potential, clear burns should be avoided because soil run-off barriers like remnants of slash-and-burn and surface litter maintain the soil and its fertility. ### Countries mentioned: Indonesia ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: small scale;spatial distribution;soil fertility;land use;spatial pattern;spatial variability;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2003,,Soil and Tillage Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-1987(02)00141-1,,#37355,,"",""
Special programme for food security as a concept for alleviating rural poverty.,"","Abstract: The Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) was launched in Indonesia in 2003 to alleviate rural poverty and food insecurity as a response to declining agricultural production. The project was located in 10 farmer groups in 6 villages in the district of Langensari Banjar, West Java province. The selected farmer groups were those in a poor food security condition with only 6-9 months out of 12 months in a safe condition. The total amount of income per household per year from several activities both on and off farm was only US $353.05. SPFS Indonesia in cooperation with Padjadjaran University developed the Farmer Group Development Plan (FGDP) for problem identification. Realistic, reliable and applicable programmes were then developed and implemented. The Department of Agriculture received funding from the Food and Agriculture Organization. This fund is given in kind to the farmers and then revolved to others farmers within the members of the group. The project has been assisting farmer groups in identifying their needs and in economic decision making. The farmer groups received 103 cattle, 36 goats, 3020 fowls, 1360 ducks, 18 650 gurami fishes, agricultural inputs (worth US $25 105.88), 16 hand tractors and 15 water pumps.

Study of key factors of spatial and feeding behaviour of free grazing cattle herds on an agrosylvopastoral tropical territory.,"","Abstract: Breeding and agriculture for autoconsumption and income, are integrated in agropastoral societies of sub-Saharian Africa. In free grazing breeding systems, herds use free crop residues besides spontaneous range resources. Cattle cover quite long distances daily, on a poor-qualitative available resource that diminishes while the dry season advances. Diet and intake level set the zootechnical performances that are directly bound with the purchasing power of breeders' families. Interactions between herds and resources are misunderstood in these systems. We are interested in evaluating the resources use sustainability and the animal performances by studying spatial and feeding behaviour of cattle. We described on the one hand factors of the daily circuits and on the other hand, some feeding variables. Circuits are structured mainly by the location of some works that are rejoined by herds: parks where cattle are tied up at night, and water points. Circuits tend to get longer while the dry season advances. This is mainly due to the decreasing available resources. Cattle herds move along the circuit continuously. They looked around some vegetation units where we estimated instantaneous intake rates: on herbaceous species, we found a median range between 45 and 50 g DM/min. Instantaneous intake rates look roughly correlated to available biomasses and type of vegetation. We finally note a collapse of daily intake rates during the dry season, falling under 4 kg DM/day before the rainy season. The identification of all of these factors must allow testing through modelling work impacts on circuits, on animal performances and on soil fertility transfers. ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;DM;soil fertility;decision maker;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;decision making;dry matter;human activity",2008,,"15èmes Recontres autour des Recherches sur les Ruminants, Paris, les 3 et 4 décembre 2008",,,,,,,#37626,,"",""
"Stakeholder Analysis for Sustainable Land Management of Pak Phanang River Basin, Thailand","","Abstract: Pak Phanang river basin, one of the most important river basins, is situated in the middle of the southern peninsula of Thailand. The construction of a water gate in 1999 to prevent salt water intrusion and separate freshwater from salt water zones has resulted in changes of the natural ecosystem and the locals' livelihood. The study aimed to identify important stakeholder groups and assess their relationships, relative power and importance for the sustainable resources use of the area. The data of this study were collected through literature reviews, focus group discussions with local stakeholders and individual interviews, using the techniques of Participatory Rapid Appraisal and conceptual content analysis. The study revealed that the most advantageous stakeholders in the coastal saltwater zone were shrimp farmers and stakeholders of related industries characterized by their relatively high input, technology and knowledge. For the coastal plain area with irrigation facilities, the majority of rice farmers benefited from increasing paddy production by intensive farming of up to 2-3 crops per year. These stakeholders' interest was conformed to the national and regional development strategies and the implementations driven by the government ministers/officials, and the royal project committees. The disadvantageous stakeholders were small-scale shrimp and rice farmers, local fishers and nypa palm harvesters, with limited investment in farming facilities to meet the changing ecosystem and the degrading of natural resources and mangrove forest. This problem was also interested by external stakeholders such as academics in the local and regional educational institutions and NGOs in identifying the needs of these disadvantageous stakeholders for sustainable land use and prevention of the critical ecosystem. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: royal project ### Topics keywords: small scale;natural resource;land degradation;rural community;land use;NGO;contract farming;SLM ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2013,,PSU-USM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.08.432,,#36167,,"",""
Stakeholder views on restoring depleted cereal fallows in arid Tunisia: Societal barriers and possible crevices,"","Abstract: All dryland countries struggle with manmade dryland degradation and climate change will reinforce this trend. In arid Tunisia (100-200 mm annual rainfall), depleted cereal fallows are a prominent feature of the desertified landscape. Based on long-term agro-ecological work with promising native steppe grasses, this work explores the societal barriers to restoring cereal fallows with these species. Interviews were conducted with 23 stakeholders (researchers, local decision makers of development agencies and land users) and 40 statements were drawn from these interviews as well as from written sources. These were sorted by 27 stakeholders (some of whom were interviewed before) following a distinct Q-sorting technique inspired by Q-methodology. Principal Components Analysis of these Q-sorts revealed three major types of barriers. (1) A widespread knowledge barrier was obvious since opinion on several agro-ecological statements was often opposite to the scientific evidence. (2) Strong convictions about the sacred nature of barley cropping and olive growing pointed to a cultural barrier to sowing steppe grasses on cereal fallows; (3) Finally, especially non-scientific agropastoralists expressed a lack of trust in any state-backed project aimed at combating desertification. Without the living proof of economic benefits of reseeding, no spontaneous uptake of reseeding can be expected. ### Countries mentioned: Tunisia ### Plant products search: barley;stone fruits ### Topics keywords: cover crop;spatial distribution;climate change;trace element;CC;CA;decision maker;principal component;economic benefit;decision making;principal component analysis;factor affecting;long term;PCA ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2011,,Journal of Arid Environments,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.04.033,,#36435,,"",""
Strategic nutrient supplementation of free-ranging goats.,"","Abstract: This paper provides an insight to nutritional limitations of forages and other feed resources and the use of supplementation technology by small farmers to optimize production potential of goats in semiarid range environments. In developing countries, the potential for goat meat production is limited by many environmental and nutritional factors. Free-ranging goats can select their diet from a complex variety of available native plant species. Forage quality and availability are reduced during winter and dry seasons of the year, affecting nutrient intake. Furthermore, the presence of plant secondary metabolites (PSM) in shrub species reduces the availability of energy, increasing the demand for glucose. Supplementation is required to mitigate both, nutrient deficiencies and the effect of PSM toxicity. Supplementation options include leguminous fodders that can serve as good protein and energy sources. However, these fodders need to be irrigated for optimum forage production. Cactus, which requires very little water and is frequently used in some developing countries as feed supplement for ruminants during periods of severe drought, has the disadvantage of high fibre and ash contents, and therefore, low energy and protein densities. Supplementation can also include energy sources such as molasses, cereal grains and byproducts, oilseeds and protein meals, minerals and vitamin A. Feed additives such as ionophores and polyethylene glycol (PEG) still need more evaluation under range conditions. Low-level (0.2-0.4% of body weight) cost-efficient high protein and mineral supplements should be considered carefully. Supplementation should be specific, considering the protein content and mineral profiles of forages in each region. Mineral and protein supplementation of goats consuming high fibre-low protein forages, generally improve intake and performance. Hand-crafted multi-nutrient blocks based on molasses and urea, can stimulate rumen fermentation and supply nutrients needed to complement deficiencies of goats consuming low quality forages. These bocks would require certain degree of compaction and the inclusion of lime (calcium oxide) that reacts with molasses will aid in hardness to restrict intake. They can be transported and managed easily and control supplement intake, while reducing the need of salt as intake regulator and the risk of urea toxicity. Technology transfer to producers should emphasis the use of cost effective and specific nutrient supplementation technology to optimize growth and reproduction of range goats. ### Plant products search: cereal grain;cereals;grain;oilseeds;citrus fruits ### Animal products search: goat meat ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;chemical composition;sweet potato;protein content;developing country;BMP;dry season;agroforestry system;pest control;beef cattle;body weight;small scale;dairy cow;DM;significant difference;cost effective;economic benefit;dairy cattle;medicinal plant;food insecurity;spatial distribution;secondary metabolite;crop residue;human activity",2010,,Small Ruminant Research,,,,,,,#36621,,"",""

These climatic irregularities disrupt agricultural activities in rural areas and affect the cultivated area but also agricultural production. But given the aggressiveness and persistence of dry periods of the late 1990s, there is an adaptation of peasant farming practices around the Montagne d'Ambre. This is based on strategies for land development that emphasize less water demanding practices. This new form of development began to spread in the region. ### Countries mentioned: Madagascar ### Topics keywords: short term;organic farming;food insecurity;climate change;time series;land degradation;farming practice;long time;growing season;NDVI;human activity;sustainable agriculture;management practice;climate variability;farming system;rural area;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2009,,Geographia Technica,,,,,,,#37576,,"",""
"Study on community characteristics and α diversity under different grazing intensity on <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Leymus chinensis</i> (Trin.) Tzvel. meadow steppe of Hulunbeier.","","Abstract: Research on the relationship between grazing intensity and the diversity of plant communities has an important significance on reasonable grassland utilization and community stability maintenance. Through the comparison experiments with different grazing intensities, this paper studied the community characteristics, grassland productivity dynamics, and α diversity in the Hulunbeier temperate meadow of Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region [Nei Mongol], China, and also analysed the correlation between productivity and diversity in order to provide a theoretical basis for the reasonable stocking rate. The results showed that the community held the highest biodiversity under moderate grazing intensity. Along with the increase of grazing intensity, the concomitant species became the subordinate dominant species. If heavy grazing continued, might be replaced by and , and then the grassland degenerated. ### Countries mentioned: China;Mongolia ### Topics keywords: stocking rate;dairy farm;specie richness;beef cattle ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2009,,Acta Agrestia Sinica,,,,,,,#37284,,"",""
Making tropical agriculture more Sustainable by using bioeconomic models,"","Abstract: Small farmers from the tropics are struggling to sustain their livelihoods while the world's natural and policy environment is changing. Trade liberalization affects many of these farmers differently- often negatively when subsidies and protections are removed, sometimes under the direction of ""structural adjustment"" programs of, for example, the IMF or the World Bank; in some cases positively when previous policies were biased against agriculture and when a freer access to market expands opportunities. Looking beyond short-term profits, the question of whether the new policies induce more sustainable production systems is still quite ambiguous. Small farmers are also struggling to adopt new technologies. There seemingly is a large variety of technologies available, but adoption is still low among small farmers from tropical countries. What type of policies and what type of technologies can help improve productivity of poor farmers while maintaining the resource base? To what degree do these new technologies make small farmers beholden to debt, the industrialized countries, and the probable future increases in the price of petroleum and its products? To answer these questions, one has to study farming systems in some detail and make some predictions about how these systems will respond, change, and adapt to external incentives while population is increasing rapidly even as natural resources are under increasing pressure. Teams of economists and agriculturalists join their expertise to link farming system analysis and natural resources processes with human behavioral models to simulate the dynamics of the farming systems under various scenarios. In this chapter we present a few applications of these bioeconomic models to address the impacts of increasing population pressure, increasing access to markets, and external incentives related to welfare and natural resources management. What are the relations between these factors and environmental degradation? What are the policy and technical options to make these systems more sustainable? In the first part of the chapter, we present the tropical agroecosystems that we studied. In the second, we review the use of bioeconomic models in agriculture. In the third we describe a few applications, and in the last part we present overall results and conclusions. The Tropical Agroecosystems Studied Tropical small-scale farming systems are numerous and diverse but can be categorized according to a gradient of management intensity from slash-and burn to permanent agriculture (Ruthenberg 1980). In this chapter we analyze and compare the fallow systems from the savanna of West Africa, the forest systems of the hillsides of Central America, the rancher system of the humid forest margin of Amazonia in Brazil, and the permanent intensive systems of the subhumid Gangetic Plain of northern India as representative of this gradient of intensification. In West Africa, increasing population pressure on land should lead, at least according to the Boserup school of thought, to labor and capital intensification and to the adoption of new technologies (Boserup 1965; see chapter 12). Instead, we observe migrations either to less-populated rural areas or to overcrowded cities. Trade liberalization of the mid-1990s was supposed to free farmers from an ""inefficient"" state, but while the devaluation of an overvalued currency had a positive impact, privatization led to market failures and too often the destruction of these farmers' way of subsistence. The three African villages studied, located on a north-south transect representing a gradient of increasing rainfall, are typical of their climatic conditions. The Sahelian village of Banizoumbou in Niger (ILRI dataset 1998) was used to predict the future of transhumance in the Sahel (Barbier and Hazell 2000). Increasing population pressure and expansion of cropland makes the traditional transhumance migrations of cattle and sheep from north to south more difficult every year. While most ""experts"" believe that nomadism has no future, a recent school of thought argues that it is the most suitable human activity for the Sahelian ecosystem (Scoones 1996). The other semiarid village, Kolbila on the Mossi Plateau of Burkina Faso (ICRISAT dataset), is less arid but is located in a much more densely populated region. Agriculture is the main activity, but its sustainability is at risk because of declining biomass and soil fertility. The village of Bala, located in the cotton-producing area of Burkina Faso (CIRAD dataset), is in a more humid region. It is less populated at present, but immigration from the north is increasing population pressure, which induces a shift from slash-and burn to a more intensive but not yet sustainable system (Barbier and BenoÎt-Cattin 1997). In Central America, we analyzed the situation of the communities on the hillsides of Honduras. In addition to being the second-poorest country of the American continent after Haiti, Honduras was hit by a hurricane in 1999, which destroyed a large part of its infrastructure and showed as well how poor management of its upper watersheds has made its valleys vulnerable to floods and landslides. Most of the fertile lowland valleys are used for extensive large-scale ranching, while small farmers struggle on the steep hillsides where the topsoil is eroding rapidly. The five Honduran watersheds where we applied bioeconomic models represent contrasting pathways of development. Farmers in the Lalima watershed follow a vegetable production pathway, producing principally a large range of vegetables. Overdrafting of the river by irrigation reduces water availability during the dry season (Barbier and Bergeron 1999). The San Nicolas watershed has become an intensive coffee production and processing area, which generates extremely high levels of water contamination that in turn affect many downstream communities (Barbier et al. 2003). The Río Calán watershed produces vegetables and coffee and supplies water to the downstream city of Siguatapeque and to a large hydroelectric dam (Jimenez et al. 2000). In the Jalapa watershed, farmers produce on steep slopes prone to rapid erosion and are part of the El Cajón watershed, which drains into a dam that generates 60 percent of the electricity used in Honduras (Hernández 2002:642). In the Choluteca watershed, widespread grain production on slopes threatens the sustainability of the shrimp industry downstream in the mangroves of the Golfo de Fonseca (Hernández et al. 2002). The large charge of sediment in the water makes shrimp production much more expensive (Samayoa 2000:647). In these watersheds, the ""pathway of development"" type applied by the population has been explained as principally a function of exogenous factors such as agroclimatic conditions, availability of spring water, and access to markets (Pender et al. 1999). The two watersheds that were well connected to markets have progressively expanded their vegetable production. Those located farther from a good paved road or major city have focused on coffee where rainfall is generous and on basic grain if the climate is drier. In Brazil, the Amazonian forest continues to shrink progressively under pressure from loggers followed by small farmers and finally ranchers. In some areas the Brazilian government is trying to prevent farmers from clearing more forest by allocating plots of a few dozen hectares of forest margin to families, under the condition that they will stay within these boundaries and clear only half of their holdings. One such settlement project takes place on the western southern border of the Amazonian forest (IFPRI dataset) in the regions of Rondonia. The objective of the study was to identify the second-best alternative to slash-and burn (Carpentier et al. 1999). Is it coffee, timber production, forest products extraction, food crop, cattle ranching, or carbon sequestration? The model was supposed to verify if the new systems are economical and environmentally sustainable. The Indian study is set in Haryana state in northern India, one of the most productive states of India, and also one of the most populated. In the 1960s and 1970s the green revolution, based on improved germ plasm, chemical fertilizers, and irrigation, transformed the state into a massive producer of rice and wheat. The adoption of new techniques was helped by heavy governmental subsidies to reduce input price and stabilize output prices especially for wheat and rice (Aggarwal et al. 2000; Dorin and Landy 2002). Now that the Indian government is trying to cut subsidies to the agricultural sector, some fear that Haryana's grain production will stagnate. Now that the government wants to reduce subsidies for water and electricity, one has to assess the likely impact on production, poverty, and the environment (Alary 2002:645). Overall, the comparative study given in this chapter includes nine farming systems in four ecoregions of five countries (tables 31.1-31.3). All except the Indian example are small-scale, semicommercialized farming systems integrating crop and livestock, using mainly hand tools with little mechanization and irrigation. They are all increasingly integrated to the market, but population pressures and resource degradation are at play. ### Countries mentioned: Haiti;Brazil;Niger;Burkina Faso;United States;Honduras;India;Guatemala ### Plant products search: wheat;rice;grain;cotton;vegetables ### Programs found: structural adjustment program (SAP);adjustment program ### Measurements for interventions: farming system ### Topics keywords: natural resource;soil fertility;carbon sequestration;sweet potato;contract farming;chemical fertilizer;winter wheat;CF;taking account;dry season;agroforestry system;large scale;farming system;long term;small scale;natural resource management;DM;soil organic carbon;climatic condition;dairy cattle;rural area;short term;ecosystem service;food insecurity;spatial distribution;green revolution;growing season;crop residue;human activity;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa;South Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2007,,Making World Development Work: Scientific Alternatives to Neoclassical Economic Theory,,,,,,,#37112,,"",""
"Assessing the effects of site heterogeneity and soil properties when unmixing photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil fractions from Landsat and MODIS data.","","Abstract: Vegetation fractional cover is a key metric for monitoring land management, both in pastoral and agricultural settings. Monitoring vegetation fractional cover continuously across large areas needs good remote sensing techniques underpinned by high quality field data to calibrate and validate algorithms. Here Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance data together with 1171 field observations across Australia were used to estimate vegetation fractional cover using a linear unmixing technique. The aim was to estimate the fractions of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV and NPV, respectively) and the remaining fraction of bare soil (BS). Landsat surface reflectance was averaged over a 3×3 pixel window representing the field area measured and also ""degraded"" using a 17×17 pixel window (∼0.26 km) to approximate the coarser MODIS sensor's response. These two Landsat surface reflectances were used to calculate a site heterogeneity metric. Data from two MODIS-derived surface reflectance products with a pixel size of ∼0.25 km were used: (i) the 16-day nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance product (MCD43A4); and (ii) the MODIS 8-day surface reflectance (MOD09A1). Log transforms and band interaction terms were added to account for non-linearities in the spectral mixing. A cross-validation step was also included to select the optimal number of singular values to avoid over-fitting. For each surface reflectance source we investigated the residuals' correlation with site heterogeneity, soil colour and soil moisture. The best model was obtained when Landsat data for a small region around each observation were used. Root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.112, 0.162 and 0.130 for PV, NPV and BS, respectively, were obtained. As expected, degrading the Landsat data to ∼0.26 km around each site decreased model goodness of fit to RMSE of 0.119, 0.174 and 0.150, respectively, for the three fractions. Using MODIS surface reflectance data gave worse results than the ""degraded"" Landsat surface reflectance, with MOD09A1 performing slightly better than MCD43A4. No strong evidence of soil colour or soil moisture influence on model performance was found, suggesting that the unmixing models are insensitive to soil colour and/or that the soil moisture in the top few millimetres of soil, which influence surface reflectance in optical sensors, is decoupled from the soil moisture in the top layer (i.e., a few centimetres) as measured by passive microwave sensors or estimated by models. This study outlines an operational combined Landsat/MODIS product to benefit users with varying requirements of spatial resolution and temporal frequency and latency that could be applied to other regions in the world. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Measurements for interventions: PV ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;MODIS;RMSE;soil moisture;NDVI;SM;RS;MT;rice straw;root mean square;spatial resolution;GIS;FAO;family farming;NT ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.021,,#36259,,"",""
Cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) breeding: A global perspective,"","Abstract: The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale L.), which first originated from Brazil, is now found throughout the tropical world and in some subtropical areas with favourable climatic conditions: rainfall not so heavy and a dry period between rainy seasons. Its economic importance lies in the commercial value of the kernel extracted from the fruit, one of the tastiest and much appreciated by the nut consumers. The cashew nut producing chain provides employment and income for thousands of people and a significant turnover for agri-business dependent countries (Barros and Crisóstomo 1995). The Cashew was introduced from Brazil into India by the Portuguese during the sixteenth century. Following its introduction into southwestern India, the cashew probably diffused throughout the Indian subcontinent. Cochin served as a dispersal point for Southeast Asia as well (Johnson 1973). A look at the evolution of the world production of cashew nut gives an understanding on how the geography of the production is changing fast. From the early 1990s, a number of Asian countries have become important producers that did not appear in the statistics previously (Table 9.1). This is a clear indication that unless the traditional producers change the systems of production in utilisation through adding technologies capable of increasing production and productivity, very little will actually be achieved to improve its capability to compete with Asiatic producers in the international market. The most important nut producers are Vietnam, India, Brazil, Nigeria and Tanzania. Collectively, these countries account for 78% of the world production, according to FAO statistical data from 2004. Vietnam has seen dramatic increases in production over the last 10 years, rising from 202,000 mt in 1995 to approximately 675,000 mt in 2004. This represents 31% of the world production and means that Vietnam replaced India as the leading producer in 2002. The boost to Vietnams nut production coincided with the stagnation of the world production. This can be explained by the slow recovery of the African cashew cultivation and the stagnation of the Brazilian production leading to the change in the producers rank. Presently cashew in India is grown in 730,000 ha with a production of 460,000 mt of raw nuts (Table 9.2). It is one of the worlds largest exporters of cashew kernel. Nevertheless, its domestic production is insufficient to supply the industrial demand. This is the reason that it has imported raw material from a number of countries in Africa (Mozambique, Tanzania, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria), Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia), Australia and South and Central America. Some of these places could aggregate value and provide jobs if the nuts are processed instead of exporting them as raw material. Mozambique has favourable ecological conditions to the development of this crop. Until the mid-1970s, it was the first cashew world producer with 210,000 mt in 1973. In 1975, the production was severely reduced to 15,000 mt due to its political problems. Due to this problem in Mozambique, the nut production in Tanzania presented a notable development until the year 1974, when it produced 140,000 mt. From this year on its production decreased. However, it increased from 2000 on, reaching 123,000 mt in 2004 (Table 9.2). In Indonesia, the cultivated area presented a substantial increase in the 1980s reaching 90,000 mt in 2004, in an area of 260,000 ha. In Nigeria, despite the increase of the cultivated area since 1999, the production remained stagnant at 186,000 mt. In Brazil, approximately 95% of the crop is produced in the three states of the Northeastern region: Cear'a, Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte, the poorest region, characterised by having more than half the area under semi-arid conditions. Cashew nut processing industry in these areas plays an important socio-economic role in the urban and rural development. Over the past few decades the cashew nut agribusiness has registered a remarkable increment. Presently, there are 700,000 ha and an industrial park capable of processing 280,000 mt of nuts annually. The importance of the cashew industry is evidenced by the export revenue to the tune of 140160 million dollars annually, along with providing thousands of direct and indirect jobs in all activities within the agro industrial chain (Barros et al. 2002; Leite and Paula Pessoa 2002). In spite of the socio-economic importance of this agri-business for a poor region, where the opportunities for reducing poverty are scarce, the cashew crop is characterised by the low usage of technology. Consequently, the productivity of the nut fell from 635 kg/ha in the early 1970s to 302 kg/ha during the 2002/2003 yield (Ibge 2004), affecting the productivity and export revenue (Paula Pessoa and Leite 1998). So it is fundamental to increase substantially the yield and productivity to make the business more profitable and attractive for new entrepreneurs. There are technologies capable of increasing production and productivity. So the crop expansion in traditional and in new potential areas as well as the approach in large stretches of unused marginal farmland should be encouraged. The most remarkable technology for the cashew crop is the selected dwarf clones because of the acceptance compared to other technologies. The main impact of these clones initially was to raise the productivity from 300 kg/ha to 1,000 kg/ha of nuts and 9,000 kg/ha of cashew apples in non-irrigated land. Later, it led to the first experiences in irrigation that resulted in as much as 3,800 kg/ha of nuts and over 34,000 kg/ha of cashew apples (Oliveira 2002). Experimentally, the last released dwarf clone produced 1,500 kg/ha of nuts in the sixth year under non-irrigated conditions (Barros et al. 2000). The use of selected clones has been changing the present situation of the cashew agri-business in Brazil. On the other hand, utilisation of cashew apple (also termed peduncle or false fruit) is gradually giving rise to an important segment of cashew agro industry with a number of industrialised products. There are over 30 products, namely, concentrated juice, sweets, soda and pure, clarified and pasteurised cashew juice called ""cajuína"", popular in the Cear'a State. The cashew apple represents approximately 90% of the fruit weight but only 58% of the production has been industrialised. It is necessary to increase its utilisation to aggregate value and profitability. Sales are gradually increasing and new markets are being opened for some of the apple products. In addition, the quality of apple from specific clones has resulted in a surprising increase in the consumption. Post-harvest experiments resulted in conservation of apple up to 20 days, making feasible the opening of new and important markets far from the origin of production and tradition. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Brazil;Australia;Viet Nam;Indonesia;Mozambique;India;Tanzania;Guinea;Guinea-Bissau ### Plant products search: pome fruits;cashews ### Measurements for interventions: cultivated area ### Topics keywords: post harvest;agro food;value chain;winter wheat;insect pest;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;international market;rural development;processing industry;FAO;long term;raw material ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa;East Asia and Pacific;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD;BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,Breeding Plantation Tree Crops: Tropical Species,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-71201-7_9,,#37127,,"",""
Feeding a future world.,"","Abstract: This article provides an overview of future prospects for feeding the world's growing population. The discussion focuses on obstacles such as limited agricultural land, degraded soil and water, and water shortages. The evidence suggests that sustainability is declining, especially in poor, food-deficit countries with growing populations. The world is segregated into the haves, the poor have-nots, and the rich have-nots. North America, Europe, and Australia have enough cropland to feed their populations. The poor have-nots are located mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, 7 countries each in the Middle East and Latin America, 6 in Oceania, and the rest in Central and South Asia. The poor have-nots amount to 3 billion out of 6 billion total population. The rich have-nots include countries such as Japan and Singapore, plus China, Indonesia, Peru, Chile, and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. The rich have-nots must import food. The world grain harvest is no longer tripling. Per person yields have declined. Increasing food productivity must rely on existing lands. The size of family farms has declined. Almost 2 billion hectares of crop and grazing land is degraded. Yields from irrigated land that are 33% of world food supply have declined. In 1990, 28 countries with 335 million people faced chronic water shortages or scarcity. Water is being polluted. Fish stocks are being depleted. Genetic diversity is being lost. In 182 food deficit countries, population growth must be slowed, and agriculture must be sustainable. Food is neither produced nor consumed equitably. Malnutrition is caused by poverty. Food security cannot be achieved if land and water become increasingly degraded or lost. ### Countries mentioned: Saudi Arabia;Australia;Chile;Peru;Singapore;Indonesia;Japan;China ### Plant products search: grain ### Animal products search: fish ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;future prospect;drought stress;SSA;water saving;water shortage;SA;agricultural machinery;smallholder farmer;food security ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;East Asia and Pacific;Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia;North America;South Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1998,,"People & the planet / IPPF, UNFPA, IUCN",,,,,,,#37143,,"",""
Increased production to maintain farmers' incomes.,"","Abstract: The increase necessary to maintain real income was considered for five farm types in W. Australia: (1) sheep farm-high rainfall zone; (2) sheep station- pastoral zone; (3) wheat-sheep farm; (4) dairy farm; and (5) potato farm. Ten year and 15 year projections were made for total costs and gross incomes assuming continuation of similar rates of change, and maintenance of real income, Projections were also tested for the effect of an increase in fertilizer cost and for increased yield from inputs, e.g. higher yielding varieties of potatoes. The aim was not to predict cost, price, income and production but to estimate increases in average farm production that might offset the effect of continued cost/price squeeze on farmers' incomes. (2) appeared most vulnerable, but the necessary increases in production were quite feasible. Although substantial increases in production would be required for (1), (3) and (4) these would not be greater than those achieved during the past 13 years, although other problems affect wheat production. In all types of farming the margin of cash surplus per unit produced was diminishing. Gross income per total cost dollar was also calculated showing the pastoral zone farmers (2) to be in the most serious position. Adjustment policies must consider more than merely improving production efficiency on individual farms. Expanded farm size should be considered. U.N.

Land tenure and land use in the arid zone.,"","Abstract: Two hypotheses are: (1) land tenure does not tend to take the form of small proprietorship; and (2) (a) land tenure is mostly of a group tenure type, and (b) given the uncertainties and risks of the agricultural and/or pastoral firm, government intervention is necessary for the achievement of stability in farm and national income. Detailed classifications of land tenure, land use and agricultural performance in 11 western states of the USA, Australia and Jordan are presented and compared. Findings show that (i) extensive land use is essential under arid conditions, (ii) extensive agriculture requires relatively large per farm acreage if the farm is to be economically viable, (iii) public ownership or control of resources is required because of scarcity of grass and water and their misuse, and (iv) government intervention is necessary to minimize farmers' uncertainty. Jordan and similar underdeveloped arid countries must adopt policies aimed at minimizing the fluctuations in agricultural productivity and farm income arising from the insidious variable environment.

"Land use, productivity and population change in South Australia, 1961-71.","","Abstract: The process of rural population changes is investigated within objectively delimited land-use regions on the assumption that such changes are responses to resource combination and relative productivities. A high level of correlation is obtained from the Cobb-Douglas production function used in testing the assumption. Differential resource productivities are observed for different land uses with labour consistently contributing the lowest in all cases. A high spatial coincidence occurs between areas of low labour productivity and areas with farm out-migrations. Farm resource combination appears to be rationally oriented, governed by the desire to optimize or maximize farm output, combinational proportions being guided by resource productivity.&lt;new para&gt;ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:&lt;new para&gt;The relationship between rural land use and the decline of rural populations in South Australia in response to agricultural mechanisation is investigated.

Opportunities and challenges in Australian grasslands: pathways to achieve future sustainability and productivity imperatives.,"","Abstract: Grassland production systems contribute 40% to Australia's gross agricultural production value and utilise &gt;50% of its land area. Across this area, diverse systems exist, but these can be broadly classified into four main production systems: (i) pastoral grazing, mainly of cattle at low intensity (i.e. &lt;0.4 dry sheep equivalents/ha) on relatively unimproved native rangelands in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern and central Australia; (ii) crop-livestock systems in the semi-arid zone where livestock graze a mixture of pastures and crops that are often integrated; (iii) high-rainfall, permanent pasture zone in the coastal hinterland and highlands; and (iv) dairy systems covering a broad range of environments and production intensities. A notable trend across these systems has been the decline in sheep numbers and the proportion of income from wool, with beef cattle or sheep meat increasingly important. Although there is evidence that most of these systems have lifted production efficiencies over the past 30 years, total factor productivity growth (i.e. change in output relative to inputs) has failed to match the decline in terms of trade. This has renewed attention on how research and development can help to increase productivity. These industries also face increasing scrutiny to improve their environmental performance and develop sustainable production practices. In order to improve the efficiency and productivity of grassland production systems, we propose and explore in detail a range of practices and innovations that will move systems to new or improved states of productivity or alter efficiency frontiers. These include: filling gaps in the array of pastures available, either through exploring new species or improving the adaptation and agronomic characteristics of species currently sown; overcoming existing and emerging constraints to pasture productivity; improving livestock forage-feed systems; and more precise and lower cost management of grasslands. There is significant scope to capture value from the ecological services that grasslands provide and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production. However, large reductions in pasture research scientist numbers (75-95%) over the past 30 years, along with funding limitations, will challenge our ability to realise these potential opportunities. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Animal products search: beef;sheep meat ### Measurements for interventions: pasture ### Topics keywords: GHG emission;environmental impact;N2O;CH4;greenhouse gas;beef cattle;greenhouse gas emission;GHG ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Pasture Science;Crop &amp,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/CP13420,,#37064,,"",""
"Potential of deficit irrigation to increase marginal irrigation response of perennial ryegrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Lolium perenne</i> L.) on Tasmanian dairy farms.","","Abstract: In the cool temperate dairy regions of Tasmania, there is heavy reliance on irrigation to maximise pasture performance by ensuring that plants do not suffer water stress. Consequently, irrigation water has often been applied at a greater amount than plant water requirements, resulting in low efficiencies. An irrigation experiment was undertaken in north-western Tasmania between October 2007 and April 2008, examining the effect of deficit irrigation treatments on pasture growth and water-use efficiency. A rainfall deficit (potential evapotranspiration minus rainfall) of 20 mm was implemented to schedule irrigation, at which point 20, 16, 12, 8, or 0 mm of irrigation water was applied, referred to as treatments I100%, I80%, I60%, I40%, and I0%, respectively. The trial was a randomised complete block design with 4 replications. There were 21 irrigation events between October and April. The experimental area was grazed by 60 Holstein Friesian heifers at a grazing interval coinciding with emergence of 2.5-3.0 new ryegrass leaves/tiller of the I100% treatment. Cumulative pasture consumption for the irrigated period was 9.2, 8.9, 7.6, 6.9, and 3.7 t dry matter(DM)/ha for the I100%, I80%, I60%, I40%, and I0% treatments, respectively. The resulting marginal irrigation water-use index (MIWUI; marginal production due to irrigation) was 1.29, 1.54, 1.55, and 1.87 t DM/ML, for the I100%, I80%, I60%, and I40% treatments, respectively. The results of this study were modelled using the biophysical model DairyMod, with strong agreement between observed and modelled data. DairyMod was then used to simulate the MIWUI for 5 differing dairy regions of Tasmania using 40 years of climatic data (1968-2007) under 3 differing nitrogen management strategies by the 5 irrigation treatments. The modelling indicated that a MIWUI greater than 2 t DM/ML can be achieved in all regions. The current study has shown that the opportunity exists for irrigated pastoral systems to better manage an increasingly scarce resource and substantially improve responses to irrigation. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Measurements for interventions: irrigation event;ML ### Topics keywords: IWUE;DM;water saving;decision maker;drip irrigation;use efficiency;deficit irrigation;dairy farm;decision making;dry matter;WUE ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2009,,Pasture Science;Crop &amp,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/CP08446,,#36558,,"",""
Soil health mapping and direct benefit: transfer of fertilizer subsidy.,"","Abstract: This report is part of a series of Strategy Papers drafted on the request of the Prime Minister's Office, India. The report deals with the current status of soil health mapping and puts forth some recommendations for the Government of India. The report states that it is essential to adopt sustainable land and nutrient management practices to maintain soil fertility which is an important pillar of sustainable agriculture. Soil health mapping is the key to unlocking sustainable practices. The sheer number of farm holdings (137 million) in the country, pose a challenge for undertaking soil health mapping. Given the enormity and complexity of the challenge the following recommendations are proposed: short-term recommendations (1-3 years)- planning, coordination and monitoring through a consortium approach; medium-term recommendations (3-5 years)- recommendations for direct benefit transfer of fertilizer subsidy; and long-term recommendations (5-7 years)- soil test-based fertilizer recommendations at taluk level. It is concluded that for the growing population of India, food and nutrition self-sufficiency can be achieved by increasing the sustainability of agriculture through the adoption of science-led developments and by taking soil science to the doorsteps of farmers in the country. The huge potential of small farm holdings can be harnessed by bridging the yield gaps and adopting soil health mapping as well as soil test-based fertilizer recommendations at the taluk level. Widespread deficiencies of multiple nutrients in the soils of India can be rectified and the sustainability of small farm holdings for livelihoods in the country can be enhanced. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: short term;current status;drought stress;SA;soil fertility;insect pest;dairy industry;special issue;self sufficiency;agricultural machinery;yield gap;medium term;management practice;sustainable agriculture;long term;food security ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2016,,Research Report - ICRISAT Development Center,,,,,,,#37174,,"",""
Spatio-temporal patterns of land use and cropping frequency in a tropical catchment of South India,"","Abstract: India's rapid population and economic growth leads to fast changing land use and management practices that have a major impact on the environment. Therefore, this study assesses spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and cropping frequencies using moderate resolution spaceborne data (Landsat 7 and LISS III). Based on a hierarchical knowledge-based classification approach, multi-temporal satellite data from the years 2000/2001 and 2010/2011 have been used to derive land use and cropping frequency maps. The approach adopted in this study resulted in a satisfactory classification quality as indicated by overall accuracies > 90% for the individual classifications. A reduced land use pressure on mountainous areas was found, indicated by an increasing development of forests within the transition zones between cultivated land and steep slopes. Furthermore, an increase of tree plantations points to a shift from drought vulnerable plants to less risk prone perennial plants. We found a higher cropping frequency in 2010/11 related to both inter-annual precipitation differences over the course of the rainy season and long-term socio-economic changes. While low yield areas are left for natural succession or switched to tree plantations, the cultivation of high yield areas was intensified. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: land use;long term;management practice;cultivated land ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2017,,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.10.011,,#37000,,"",""

"Standardization of novel technique for preparation of ginger (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Zingiber officinale</i>)-blended wine from different cultivars of pear (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Pyrus communis</i>).","","Abstract: In North-West Himalayas including Kumaon region of Uttarakhand pear ( L.) cultivars like Jagner, Sand Pear and Kakria are being grown with very high yield and productivity but due to poor market the growers are reluctant to harvest the crop because of which the nutritious fruits are spoiled in the orchards. Except for Jagner which is soft and used for table purpose, there are very few takers for other cultivars like Sand Pear and Kakria. All the cultivars are rich in various phyto-chemical characters including anti-oxidants. Hence, for reducing the huge spoilage of nutritious fruits, an attempt was made to standardize a novel technique for pear wine from three cultivars after blending their juice with 2.5% ginger ( Roc) juice, 0.1% DAHP and 0.2% pectinol. After complete fermentation with yeast, var. , the prepared base wines were siphoned/filtered at regular intervals and stored at ambient conditions. A significant difference was recorded in bio-chemical and sensory quality attributes of the wines after preparation and 6 months storage. Among all the treatments ginger-blended Sand Pear wine prepared by raising the TSS to 22°B and having 2.5% ginger juice had an edge over other treatments in overall quality. A significant reduction in all the parameters was recorded irrespective of the cultivars used for wine preparation. On the basis of the study the cost of production of ginger-blended pear wine was found quite reasonable (Rs 93.10, 73.10 and 73.10/650 ml bottle for Jagner-ginger, Sand Pear-ginger and Kakria-ginger wines respectively) with good profit margin comparable with low alcoholic beverages available in the market. ### Plant products search: pome fruits;ginger ### Topics keywords: treated sewage sludge;COD;significant difference;TSS;TP;sewage sludge",2017,,Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences,,,,,,,#37600,,"",""
Stimulating interest in and adoption of precision agriculture methods on small farm operations.,"","Abstract: In 2005, West Virginia University Extension provided seed money to demonstrate precision soil sampling and precision nutrient management. West Virginia University Extension Service partnered with a crop consultant and ""custom applicator"" (Fullen Fertilizer) to perform this task. In 2006 11 land owners consigned 670 acres to an expanded demonstration. These farms were soil sampled using conventional (1.38 acres per sample) and precision (1.87 acres per sample) method. WVU Extension paid for the conventionally taken samples. The individual soil data points were used to determine the number of acres represented by the sample, the soil type and yield potential for alfalfa, mixed grass and corn from soil survey. Results showed that precision sampling and application required more lime than recommended by conventional sampling. Precision management required more phosphorous and less potash on fewer acres than recommended by conventional management. Extension education through presentations, a field day and farmer to farmer talks resulted in 1545 additional acres being sampled. Over 1600 acres received precision application of lime, phosphorous and potash. This occurred on five of the twelve cooperators and eight new land owners. Producers have used this information to change management practices including using mineral feeders and hay placement to guide cattle to specific field areas, delineate areas for variable nutrient application using conventional equipment. Acquisition of precision tools has increased in the area. Private consultants are partnering to help farmers interpret collected data. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Plant products search: maize;alfalfa;wheat;citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: management practice;extension service;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2008,,"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Precision Agriculture, Denver, Colorado, USA, 20-23 July, 2008",,,,,,,#37273,,"",""
Strategies for food security and health improvement in the sub-saharan Africa.,"","Abstract: Health and nutritional geography in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) demand urgent remedial actions. The subcontinent is ravaged by such pandemics as malaria, African sleeping sickness, human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Poverty level stands at 47%. There is severe malnutrition. 30 of the 45 countries with low or critically low level of food security between 1991 and 1993 are in SSA. Food availability in the subcontinent, which stands at 2100 kcal/person/day, is the poorest in the world. Health indices are infant mortality and life expectancy. Improvement in food production in SSA will boost per capita gross domestic product, raise purchasing power and improve access to therapeutic and prophylactic health management. It will reduce pervasive poverty that translates into nutritional diseases, human immunodeficiency virus infection risks and reduced life expectancy. This demands the support of the various states in the form of legislation, administration and finance. Women empowerment will improve investment on land and productivity. Research is needed on new technologies that are output-driven, ecologically friendly, acceptable and affordable to source-poor farmers. Prototypes of farm tools and machines should be mass produced and made available to well-informed local farmers. Research should aim at increased nutrient content and yield of endemic cultivars, disease control, reduced desertification and sustainable land use, improvement of indigenous innovations on renewable water resources utilization, and reduced field and post harvest losses. Good governance and stable polity are essentials for food security and health in SSA. ### Topics keywords: post harvest;SSA;GDP;land use;insect pest;gross domestic product;factor influencing;smallholder farmer;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2007,,World Journal of Agricultural Sciences,,,,,,,#37610,,"",""
"Striga infestation in Kenya: status, distribution and management options.","","Abstract: spp. is considered to be the greatest biological constraint to food production in sub-Saharan Africa, a more serious problem than insects, birds and plant diseases. They are among the most specialized root-parasitic plants inflicting serious injury to their host depriving them water, minerals and photosynthate. The greatest diversity of spp. occurs in grassland. However, mainly occurs in farmland infecting grasses. The parasite devastating effect is accomplished prior to its emergence from the soil. It may cause yield losses in cereals ranging from 15% under favourable conditions to 100% where several stress factors are involved, thereby affecting the livelihood of millions of resource-poor farmers. Piecemeal approach to address one aspect of problem at a time has been a setback in technology transfer to producers. Future control programs should not be conducted separately, but should rather be conducted in an integrated approach that combines research talents of various institutions. This will facilitate collaborative research and achieve qualitative interaction between stakeholders, which can easily produce reliable technologies that are practical and available to farmers. being a pervasive pest, time is of essence in controlling it. There is an urgent need for the establishment of policies to promote, implement, and ensure a long-term sustainable control program. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: cereals ### Programs found: control program (CCP) ### Measurements for crops: cereals ### Topics keywords: contract farming;smallholder farmer;long term;SSA ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2013,,Sustainable Agriculture Research,,,,,,,#36634,,"",""
"Structural adjustment, primary resource trade and sustainable development in sub-Saharan Africa","","Abstract: The food shortages, growing indebtedness and the appalling environmental crisis in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be understood in isolation from the strategies of development policies in the area of African governments have followed since independence. While adjustment policies in the area of pricing, exchange rates, public sector reform and liberalization of markets are some of the essential ingredients of a balanced national strategy, conventional International Monetary Fund/ World Bank prescriptions have often resulted in negative social and ecological effects. These short-term policies, designed to improve commodity exports to generate foreign exchange, often conflict with long-term development needs. Scarce land, water, credit and technology are being preempted by the export sector while the needs of small farmers in the areas of soil conservation, reforestation and food security are ignored. For sustainable development to occur, there must be a fundamental reorientation of government policies and resources toward solving rural problems. Land reform, credit, improved extension, greater government accountability, and people's participation are important prerequisites if poor farmers are to succeed. Further, policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa needs to be backed by improved measures to compensate for shortfalls in commodity export earnings caused by factors outside their control. Finally, significant debt write offs by bilateral and multilateral agencies are a sine qua non if sub-Saharan Africa is to resume a steady path of development. ### Topics keywords: short term;land reform;sustainable development;SSA;public sector;exchange rate;factor influencing;contract farming;smallholder farmer;long term;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",1992,,World Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0305-750X(92)90039-X,,#37103,,"",""
STRUCTURAL-CHANGES IN THE AUSTRIAN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR,"","Abstract: The purpose of this article is to analyze the economic and sociological consequences of structural changes in the Austrian agricultural sector. Whereas a portion of 33 percent of persons in employment worked within the agricultural sector in 1953, this quote has diminished substantially to a value of 6,3 percent in 1990. Despite of this enormous migration of rural labor forces from farming the increasing labor productivity has lead to an extraordinary stimulation of agricultural production beyond the markets' adsorption capacity. Due to the fact that internal consumption did not grow at the same extent, the situation of excess demand - predominant for a long period of time - has moved into new circumstances with surpluses in the most important product markets. This development has been accompanied by severe problems of exporting excess goods on to a stagnant world market. Compared to other sectors, there was an unfavourable development of agricultural incomes producing also large contrasts between big, medium, and small size family farms. A further problem caused by the intensification of production techniques are environmental damages. Polluted water, impoverished land and problems of erosion are both results of an increased utilization of pesticides and fertilisers and of overstocking by cattle in the livestock farming. Additionally the process of industrialization in the agricultural sector has also altered the social structure in the rural word. Because of the migration process there are a lot of agricultural enterprises in which the farm manager and his wife are the only working forces available. Improved training facilities of young girls in rural regions have also changed the condition of entrance into an agricultural enterprise. So it is recognized today that the peasant woman is rather securing the existence of a farm than the other way round. But this central position of countrywomen who are responsible for a lot of different activities has also caused a substantial load of work and several injuries to health. Moreover, feelings of isolation and estrangement are arising, based on the division of labor in the process of agricultural production. A growing integration of the agricultural sector into macroeconomic processes has also altered rural systems of values and norms. The growing importance of part-time farming, improved possibilities for children from rural regions to attend secondary schools and changed producer-consumer relationships form the most important channels of an intersectoral opening of farming. The last section deals with existing policy alternatives and gives an introduction to the Austrian concept of a social agricultural policy considering ecological aspects (Okosoziale Agrarpolitik). The discussion of an amortization of non market values offered by the agricultural sector finishes the paper. ### Countries mentioned: Austria ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;animal welfare;VI;arable land;dairy farming;livestock farming;structural change;dairy industry;point view;adsorption capacity;factor influencing;rice straw;crop residue;animal health;farming system;beef cattle ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1993,,BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT,,,,,,,#37151,,"",""
"Structural unemployment, small towns and agrarian change in South Africa.","","Abstract: The paper seeks to analyse the predicament of a constantly expanding but politically neglected constituency: ex-farmworkers and their families concentrated in the new shack peripheries of small towns throughout the highveld region of South Africa. Despite the forces of political transformation which enfranchized this group in April 1994, it is the forces of drought and economic recession, of capital intensification and positive real interest, that have shaped, and often diminished, real life opportunities for them. The paper has three objectives. First at the macro-level, it identifies significant trends in structural employment in the mining industry and on white-owned farms. Secondly, at the meso-level, the results of small surveys carried out of inhabitants of the shack peripheries of two small towns, Tweespruit and Dewetsdorp, are examined.

Studies in the dynamics and control of woody weeds in semi-arid Queensland. 1. Eremophila gilesii.,"","Abstract: Under present systems of grazing management, populations of E. gilesii have increased in mulga (Acacia aneura) communities, particularly in cleared areas. Ploughing-out stands of E. gilesii, slashing at ground level and application of herbicides were effective methods of killing the plant, 1% 2,4,5-T ester/diesel distillate being the most effective herbicide combination. The shrub is periodically attacked by a wingless grasshopper (Monistria pustulifera) and when infestation is high, large areas of E gilesii are killed. A stocking rate of 12 sheep/ha in Sept.-Oct. 1971 reduced the number of E. gilesii fruits from 111/bush in the ungrazed controls to 2.2 in the grazed area.&lt;new para&gt;ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:&lt;new para&gt;The grasshopper Monistria pustulifera (Wlk.) was observed in large numbers feeding on the woody weed Eremophila gilesii at Charleville, Queensland, Australia, in 1969-72. Adults were sedentary, and the fully winged form was usually rare, but became more numerous as the population density increased. The grasshoppers stripped the leaves, then removed any regrowth, and finally removed the bark from the stems. Over 500 ha of dense bush was completely destroyed in 1970, and grasshopper numbers were again high in 1971-72.&lt;new para&gt;ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:&lt;new para&gt;Present clearing of mulga (Acacia aneura) communities in south-western Queensland is leading to invasion by the undesirable shrub, E. gilesii. The invasive capacity of this species was demonstrated by experiments in which A. aneura stands free from E. gilesii were thinned in 1964. Within 7 years numerous E. gilesii were present at early stages of colonization. Several control methods were evaluated; high rates of commonly-used arboricides, particularly 2,4,5-T ester at 1% a.i. in diesel distillate, and root cutting or ploughing, gave successful control but less costly and equally effective in the long term was heavy stocking of E. gilesii stands with sheep which, by grazing the flowers, considerably reduced fruit-set. The frequent grasshopper infestations during 1969-70 succeeded in stripping the shrubs of their foliage and bark. Before any control measures are put into effect, however, the role of E. gilesii in the nutrient cycles of the region must be considered. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Plant products search: fruits ### Topics keywords: stocking rate;spatial distribution;biological control;population density;protected area;dairy farm;human activity;beef cattle;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1973,,Queensland Journal of Agricultural and Animal Sciences,,,,,,,#37062,,"",""

"Study on the development of agricultural machines for small-scale farmers, Part 2 (applied technology to the improvement of an animal-drawn plow for Morocco and Africa).","","Abstract: The purpose of this research is to improve the working performance of the animal-drawn plough for small-scale farmers in Africa, as based on conditions in Morocco. Animal-traction farming is not widespread in Africa, except in a few regions. Furthermore, tractor cultivation is still difficult for small-scale farmers due to economic constraints and the need for shared use of machines, which involves solving operational, technical and maintenance problems. The ploughing depth with seed-covering cultivation is ∼10 cm on the dry land of Morocco. Traction forces are, therefore, low during actual operation. As a result, stable operation of animal-drawn ploughs and subsequent reduction of the work load on the draught animals are being sought for farming operations. The decrease in the standard deviation (SD) of measured data (amplitude of ranges) of the draught force was selected as the performance evaluation parameter for stable and efficient handling and for steady operation. Throughout these experiments, the longest plough sole (51 cm) turned out to be the element that contributed most to the uniformity of plough performance when draught force, required horsepower, stepping reduction rate, and operational stability were considered. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco ### Topics keywords: small scale;animal welfare;plant height;sustainable development;agricultural machinery;extension service;RO;small scale farmer;stocking density;stem diameter;seawater desalination ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2005,,"AMA, Agricultural Mechanization in Asia, Africa and Latin America",,,,,,,#37290,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-14 05:57:17)(Screen): Doesn't address income/productivity.; ,""
Subsistence and market farming in Northern Thailand: differential effects of purchased inputs and farm size on productivity.,"","Abstract: The paper analyzes data from a study of farmers in northern Thailand to investigate the effects of farm size on use of purchased inputs and hired labour, and on farm productivity and profitability. Data on the rainy season and dry season crops show rather different results, suggesting that the question of differences between market-oriented and subsistence-oriented production may be especially important. It is found that while farm size is related to farm production under traditional conditions, it does not directly affect production under market-oriented cropping. For the sample studied, small farm size was also not a limiting factor in adopting multiple cropping or purchasing farm chemicals. Some differences in efficiency of use of purchased inputs and hired labour were observed between small and large farms, however. Production strategy thus appears to be crucial to the resolution of the farm size/farm efficiency debate. Traditional subsistence-oriented systems seem to elicit an allocation of resources different from market-oriented and presumably profit-maximizing strategies, even when the same farmers are involved in both kinds of production. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;farm size;sweet potato;crop residue;human activity ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1986,,Studies in Comparative International Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02717366,,#36764,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-14 05:53:40)(Screen): No on-farm intervention.; ,""
Substrates on rooting of blackberry xavante herbaceous cuttings [Substratos no enraizamento de estacas herbáceas de amora-preta xavante],"","Abstract: The blackberry (Rubus spp.) stands out among the species that have good prospects for cultivation in areas of family farm agriculture. In order to optimize the multiplication of seedlings of this species, the aim of this research was to evaluate the use of different substrates and concentrations of indolebutyric acid (IBA) on the rooting of cuttings of blackberry Xavante. The experiment was performed using the completely randomized design in a 3x2 factorial arrangement (three substrates and two concentrations of IBA), with five replications of seven cuttings, and the following factors were adopted: types of substrates (vermiculite medium granules, carbonized rice husk and coconut fiber) and treated or not treated with IBA (0 and 1000mg L-1). After 80 days, the following variables were evaluated: cuttings survival; leaf retention; rooted cuttings; root number per cutting; length of the longest root; dry weight of roots per cutting; and pH; electrical conductivity; bulk density and water retention capacity of the substrates. There was no influence of the substrates and the IBA on the percentage of rooted cuttings, verifying the high efficiency on rooting of the blackberry Xavante cuttings (86.2%). For the percentage of cuttings survival the best result was obtained without the IBA application. It was concluded that the blackberry Xavante can be propagated by herbaceous cuttings efficiently, using the carbonized rice husk as low-cost option. ### Countries mentioned: Philippines ### Plant products search: coconuts;rice;soft fruits ### Topics keywords: plant height;bulk density;EC;drought stress;dry weight;electrical conductivity;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,Ciencia Rural,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1590/S0103-84782012005000135,,#37357,,"",""
Successional processes in agricultural mosaics in the eastern Amazon,"","Abstract: Most tropical landscapes are mainly composed of dynamic mosaics involving multiple land uses. Different histories of land use management can lead to different successional paths. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a successional floristic gradient related to land use types and how these gradients change across three rural mosaics in Eastern Amazon. We also investigated what are the indicator species across mosaics and land use types and how they change through succession. Five sampling points were established in nine family farms at each mosaic. A detrended correspondence analysis was used to reveal the successional gradient. A multivariate regression tree was used to analyze differences in floristic composition between mosaics and land uses. Floristic similarity between land uses formed successional gradient at the mosaics, in which agricultural land uses represent the early stages of secondary succession and forests represent more advanced stages. Total number of species and total number of shade-tolerant species were correlated with advanced successional stages in all mosaics, but pioneer trees were also correlated with advanced stages in fragmented mosaics. Each mosaic had a distinct successional series due to different management approaches. Where the matrix was mainly composed of forest fragments and the human intervention period was shorter, land use types were more similar to one another as they were grouped into fewer successional stages. Thus, the floristic similarity between land use types appears as an indicator of successional advancement across the mosaics and help determine the regenerative capacity of those areas. ### Topics keywords: used analyze;land use;specie richness;factor affecting",2018,,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.12.004,,#36989,,"",""
Such a coveted land area of Cameroon.,"","Abstract: A study is made of conflict over land in the Wum region of North-West Cameroon. In the 1950s the Aku, a pastoral tribe from nearby Nigeria, brought their herd to the region. The local Bororo tribe, who mainly grew crops, agreed that the Aku cattle could graze on uncultivated land. Over time the region was adversely affected by drought, population increase and overgrazing, and by the 1970s a conflict had arisen between the tribes. The regional government formed a commission to try to resolve the problems, and attempts were made to separate farmland from pasture. However, the conflict persists: farmers cannot afford proper fencing for their crops, which are then trampled by cattle; there is jealousy because livestock have become more profitable than crops; and there are accusations of bribery and corruption among officials. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Cameroon ### Topics keywords: point view;cultivated land;net return ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1996,,Grain de Sel,,,,,,,#36429,,"",""
Suitable for whom? The case of system of rice intensification in Tanzania,"","Abstract: Purpose: This study examines the suitability of the system of rice intensification (SRI) for diverse small-scale farmers in Tanzania by exploring if poor and non-poor farmers adopt the system to a similar extent. Originality: The suitability of low-external input technologies such as SRI for diverse African farmers is a contentious issue. Existing studies suggest that adoption may be skewed away from poorer farmers, but no studies have explicitly categorized farmers who participate in adoption of SRI. Methods: Farmers exposed to SRI were randomly surveyed. Sample farmers were categorized into three socioeconomic groups–wealthier, middle-wealth, and poorer–using factor and cluster analysis approaches. Wealth category is then used in a logit model to determine probabilities of adopting SRI practices across the different groups. Findings: The results indicate that middle-wealth group adopt SRI to a greater extent compared to the wealthier and poorer groups. The extent of adoption by wealthier and poorer groups is similar, although constraining circumstances differ. Access to factors that consistently explained adoption: contact with extension services, land with water, and labor, vary systematically among groups. Theoretical implication: Low adoption is often assumed on reduced exposure to a technology, and non-adopters are expected to eventually adopt. The results suggest, however, that farmers, who have not adopted, may not do so, even after being exposed. SRI as a package does not fit their socioeconomic conditions. Practical implications: To support adoption across all wealth categories, extension should focus on promoting individual practices rather than the package to enable farmers adopt practices that fit their socioeconomic characteristics. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: small scale;genetic diversity;spatial distribution;trace element;CA;cluster analysis;special issue;extension service;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2017,,Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2017.1310660,,#36891,,"",""

However, sulfate was more subject to interference from external influences, particularly fertilizers, grazing animals, and rain. A soil test is advocated in which both soil sulfate and organic-S are measured. Organic-S, extracted by phosphate (20 msmallcap˜M), is measured to indicate the long-term supplying power of the soil (also related to total organic-C and -S); and sulfate is measured to indicate any additions from external sources which would have a short-term effect on pasture growth. The latter is estimated as the sulfate in excess of the quasi equilibrium value, based on the organic-S value. Potassium phosphate, in contrast to calcium phosphate, did not inhibit the extraction of organic-S (and organic matter generally) at organic-C ¬&gt;5%. Consequently, the organic-S extracted by potassium phosphate correlated much better with pasture response to S, and is the recommended extractant. Both potassium and calcium phosphates extracted the same amount of sulfate. The sulfate mineralized during short-term incubation, and the organic-S extracted by 0.5 smallcap˜M sodium bicarbonate, did not correlate with S response in pasture as well as organic-S extracted by potassium phosphate. The alkaline bicarbonate extracted ∼5 times more organic-S than potassium phosphate, but extracted a similar amount of sulfate. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Topics keywords: short term;EC;DM;OM;soil organic carbon;OC;TOC;DOC;organic matter;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1996,,Australian Journal of Soil Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/SR9960405,,#37455,,"",""
Support measures for local innovation processes and integration of poor farmers in the dry mountain areas of Central America: a difficult articulation.,"","Abstract: Central America's tropical dry mountain areas are characterized by poverty of their peasant populations, high levels of food insecurity and vulnerability of the environment, and a relatively marginal position in national society and economy. Despite tangible results for some direct beneficiaries of development interventions in this region, it is clear that there is a large gap between the objectives and the actual effects of interventions in terms social integration of the poorest or the emergence of a sustainable development process. This paper presents the results of research being conducted on measures to foster local innovation processes as a form of response to the challenges that farmers and families face. ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;specie richness;sustainable development",2010,,"Proceedings of a symposium on Innovation and Sustainable Development in Agriculture and Food, Montpellier, France, 28 June to 1st July 2010",,,,,,,#36483,,"",""
Supporting farmer-led irrigation in Mozambique: reflections on field-testing a new design approach.,"","Abstract: Smallholder irrigation technologies introduced in sub-Saharan Africa are often unsustainable in the sense that they are not maintained by their users. In contrast, there is clear evidence that smallholder farmers have been developing and expanding irrigated areas. An approach was developed that takes these farmers' initiatives as a starting point to stimulate further irrigated agricultural expansion in central Mozambique, dubbed the PIAD approach (Participatory Irrigated Agricultural Development). The approach was documented through field diaries, participatory monitoring and evaluation. This article presents an analysis and reflection on the design process. Amongst other things, it shows that a crucial difference is the division of roles between users, contractors and irrigation engineers, both in terms of division of responsibilities and in understanding the interdisciplinary connections of irrigated agricultural production. The approach allowed users to be kept in the driver's seat of development while going beyond improving irrigation infrastructure, including agronomic and institutional interventions. Additionally, the results show that technologies are being sustained by their users and copied by farmers in neighboring areas. We conclude that the approach allows for active investment by the users, both in design as well as in project costs and labor, which later results in the improvements being maintained and copied, a clear marker of sustainability. ### Countries mentioned: Mozambique ### Programs found: farmer initiative ### Topics keywords: human health;point view;smallholder farmer;SSA ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2016,,Sustainability,,,,,,,#37511,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-14 05:39:17)(Screen): Didn't address relevant outcomes - productivity and incomes.; ,""
Sustainability of agricultural model of Faé watershed using multivariable analysis [Sustentabilidade do modelo agrícola da bacia do riacho Faé],"","Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the families living in the part of the stream Faé watershed. It was based on the existing agricultural model and it was used the multivariate analysis. Forms ""cross-over"" types with subjective and objective questions were applied for socio-economic and environmental study area. To observe the similarities between the studied families applied Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to data. It was identified two distinct groups. Group I was formed by families with characteristics typically agriculturalist with low income families developing their productive activities in a rudimentary way. Those families use pesticides and they represent a risk both to support agricultural model and to the lives of those families. Group II was formed by families who, even so located in agricultural environment, present typically urban characteristics. In those families there are many young people, many people with low level of schooling and they have no agricultural economic activity. Cluster analysis was efficient to separate the homogeneous groups of families in the study area regardless of geographic location. ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;spatial distribution;trace element;young people;CA;rural community;cluster analysis;rural area",2011,,Revista Ciencia Agronomica,,,,,,,#37193,,"",""
Sustainability of farm and farmers through eco-friendly IFS approach.,"","Abstract: The income of the small farmers that comprises over 3/4 of the farmers is too meagre to support the families. The problem cannot be more excruciating in arid and semi arid area under the jurisdiction of SDAU where harsh climatic conditions peppered with wreaking problems of agriculture like fragmentation of holdings, dissipating natural resources base, back breaking cost of inputs etc are the rules rather than aberrations. The agriculture in North Gujarat is largely animal husbandry based. SDAU developed a model of integrated different agriculture activities entailing soil, plant, animal and farmers family as a functional unit to harness more regular income per unit of area with sustainability of health of each component including natural resources base and farmer. The system is based on in vogue cropping system on 0.70 ha of 1.00 ha farm viz; (i) green gram-mustard-summer pearl millet (0.24 ha), (ii) groundnut-wheat-fodder pearl millet (0.08 ha), (iii) green gram-castor relay (0.32 ha) and (iv) fodder cowpea-lucerne+chicory (0.06 ha) to ensure annual calorie and nutritional requirement of the family. Both income and health were made more sustainable by growing fruits and vegetable in two tiers on 0.25 ha. The soil health was taken care of by including pulses in cropping system, making microbes enriched vermin-compost from the waste and dung of the two buffaloes reared on 0.04 ha. Farm wastes were recycled within the system which obliterated the need to purchase off-farm inputs. The internal bunds were used for growing fodder while on boundaries quick growing timber tree like Alianthus were planted to brace up income. The model had a provision of farm pond (0.01 ha) for water harvesting and well recharging on low lying depression of the farm. The model also entailed trees like glaceredia at regular interval whose nutritious leaves were lopped and added to soil to enhance soil fertility. The system has been functional for the last five years and the cursory analysis of the investment indicated that system is good enough to provide daily income of Rs 990/day with engagement of 0.84 unit of labour/day. The income can be further ramped up by growing medicinal annuals and herbs on bunds and including other components of farming like poultry, goatary, piggery etc. The continuous sustainable income and livelihood security throughout the year can be fruitful to check urban migration. ### Plant products search: pome fruits;green gram;wheat;millets;lucerne;cowpeas;groundnuts;fruit vegetables;grain legumes;mustard;chicory ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: compost;farm pond;dung ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;natural resource;cropping system;eco friendly;winter wheat;soil fertility;environmental impact;growing season;LCA;climatic condition;taking account;functional unit;IFS;farming system;sustainable agriculture;long term",2016,,Indian Agriculturist,,,,,,,#37302,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-14 05:33:15)(Screen): No counterfactual.; ,""
"Survey of major diseases affecting dairy cattle in Jimma town, Oromia, Ethiopia","","Abstract: The aim of the survey was to assess major diseases and access to veterinary service delivery of smallholder dairy cattle under intensive production system in Jimma town, Ethiopia. A single-visit-multiplesubject formal survey technique was used to collect data from 54 small-scale dairy farming households which were selected at random and were interviewed using pre-tested, structured questionnaire. It appeared from the study that mastitis (35.2%), internal parasites (14.8%), lumpy skin disease (13%) and heart water (5.6%) were identified as the most frequently occurring diseases. Results of the survey of major dairy cattle disease in the study area ranked mastitis as number one disease of dairy animals. Average mortality of calves, heifers, lactating cows and dry cows over 12 months was 0.82±1.00, 0.27±0.60, 0.64±1.06 and 0.13±0.40, respectively. It was observed that loss of calves (16%), heifers (5.6%) and lactating cows (16.7%) were due to lumpy skin disease, followed by heart water affecting 5.6, 3.7 and 1.9% of calves, heifers and lactating cows, respectively. Most of the respondents (90.7%) did not practice traditional ethno-veterinary treatment, whereas 9.3% of the farmers used traditional treatment practices and the remaining 13% respondents used a combination of veterinary services and traditional ethno-veterinary methods to treat their animals. It was suggested that proper animal management, cleanliness and good hygiene on dairy farms and practices of mastitis control measures such as udder disinfection and dry-cow therapy and adequate veterinary services would help to alleviate cattle health constraint in the study area. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Measurements for interventions: mastitis ### Topics keywords: small scale;value chain;veterinary service;dairy farming;dairy cow;lactating cow;dairy farm;smallholder dairy;dairy cattle;animal health ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2012,,Global Veterinaria,,,,,,,#37145,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-14 05:36:33)(Screen): No intervention.; ,""
Sustainability of traditional agriculture in the southern african savannas of botswana,"","Abstract: A large proportion of the population in Botswana resides in rural areas and is primarily dependent on subsistence agriculture and the use of renewable resources for their livelihoods. The climatic cycles of droughts limit the potential of the area for intensive agricultural production. The dependency of the rural population on natural resources through agricultural practices has led to intensive use of natural resources in selected areas, especially close to water points or better rainfall and hardveld areas. Unfortunately most of the hardveld areas are located in higher elevations that make them suitable for intensive crop production or grazing without proper soil management.This paper seeks to describe and discuss the impacts of agricultural practices by communal and traditional farmers on the sustainable management of savannas in Botswana. Sustainability will be explained from three viewpoints, namely, ecosystem sustainability, economic performance and access to land. ### Countries mentioned: Botswana ### Topics keywords: natural resource;rural area;biogas production ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2003,,South African Geographical Journal,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/03736245.2003.9713779,,#37420,,"",""
Sustainable agriculture and eradication of rural poverty in Pakistan.,"","Abstract: Poverty is rampant in the rural areas of Pakistan, where people are in a state of deprivation with regard to incomes, clothing, housing, healthcare, education, sanitary facilities and human rights. Agriculture generates nearly 20.9 percent of the country's GDP and provides employment for 43.4 percent of its workforce. Most importantly, 65.9 percent of the population living in rural areas is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Rising population, shrinking agricultural land, increasing demand for water resources, widespread land degradation and inadequate infrastructure appear to be major concerns of the agriculture sector in Pakistan. An attempt has been made to examine the population growth-agriculture growth-poverty alleviation linkage. It is argued that agriculture will continue to be one of the most important sectors of Pakistan's economy for years to come. To alleviate poverty, it is suggested that Pakistan enhance the productivity of the agriculture sector through the provision of a series of inputs including provision of easy credit to the small farmer, availability of quality fertilizers and pesticides, tractor and harvester services, improvement in the effectiveness of the vast irrigation system and, finally, farmer education. It is concluded that the high rate of population growth needs to be curbed for increased agricultural productivity to have any significant effect on poverty in rural areas of Pakistan. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan ### Measurements for interventions: workforce ### Topics keywords: small scale;health care;drought stress;land degradation;poverty alleviation;SA;rural household;rural poverty;GDP;LD;factor influencing;sustainable agriculture;rural development;dairy farming;gross domestic product;rural area;management practice;food security ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2007,,Natural Resources Forum,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-8947.2007.00162.x,,#36458,,"",""
Sustainable intensification in smallholder agriculture: An integrated systems research approach,"","Abstract: Sustainable intensification has recently been developed and adopted as a key concept and driver for research and policy in sustainable agriculture. It includes ecological, economic and social dimensions, where food and nutrition security, gender and equity are crucial components. This book describes different aspects of systems research in agriculture in its broadest sense, where the focus is moved from farming systems to livelihoods systems and institutional innovation. Much of the work represents outputs of the three CGIAR Research Programs on Integrated Systems for the Humid Tropics, Aquatic Agricultural Systems and Dryland Systems. The chapters are based around four themes: the conceptual underpinnings of systems research; sustainable intensification in practice; integrating nutrition, gender and equity in research for improved livelihoods; and systems and institutional innovation. While most of the case studies are from countries and agro-ecological zones in Africa, there are also some from Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. ### Programs found: farming system research (FSR) program;research program;CGIAR research program (CRP);integrated system research program;CGIAR research program (CRP2) ### Topics keywords: sustainable intensification;drought stress;CA;nutrition security;SA;smallholder farmer;farming system;sustainable agriculture;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Latin America and the Caribbean",2017,,Sustainable Intensification in Smallholder Agriculture: An Integrated Systems Research Approach,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315618791,,#37053,,"",Observational
Sustaining future food security in changing environments,"","Abstract: Access to adequate food and nutrition is a fundamental human right. However, a significant population worldwide presently suffers from malnutrition and inadequate access to food. To meet the goal of zero hunger and malnutrition, agricultural production must maintain pace with increasing food demand. This goal is being challenged by rapidly changing socio-economic and environmental issues. Climate change, depleting soil and water resources, air, water and soil pollution are not only reducing productivity, but also pose a threat to food safety and nutrition. This book analyzes linkages between agriculture and environmental changes, major challenges and potential solutions to secure future food security. It covers, in detail, the impacts of major environmental changes including climate change and air pollution on crops and agricultural production. The potential solutions to address these challenges are also discussed. This book provides the reader with a broad view of interactions between agriculture and the environment, where agriculture is not only vulnerable but also acts as a contributor and offers mitigation options for some of the challenges in sustaining future food security. Agricultural sustainability in near and long-term future will depend on adapting crops and crop management practices based on emerging scientific knowledge of plant physiology and resource efficient technologies combined with focused socio-economic reforms to conserve food diversity and traditional practices. With the help of specific case studies, this book also highlights the significance of reforming small scale farming practices. Overall, this book provides the core idea of sustainable agriculture and food production in current and future scenarios, and is recommended for anyone interested in this topic. ### Topics keywords: small scale;organic farming;cover crop;climate change;drought stress;land degradation;CC;farming practice;food safety;SA;management practice;farming system;sustainable agriculture;long term;food security",2017,,Sustaining Future Food Security in Changing Environments,,,,,,,#36168,,"",Observational
Sustainable agriculture and food security of Bangladesh-issues recommendations,"","Abstract: Bangladesh agriculture heavily depends on chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Application of these compounds over a long period resulted into poor soil fertility, human and animal health hazards, disturbed eco-balance, all leading to low productivity, soil, water and air pollution. Moreover, the cost of agriculture has increased manifold with declining yield levels and growing dependence on market for purchase of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hence the most urgent concern is to make judicious use of chemical inputs and application of bio-products so as to ensure minimal damage to the environment without any reduction in yield of crops. Food security is also challenging considering the climate change, land degradation and natural disasters. Until recently, sustainable agricultural technologies are not highlighted as important both by the research institutions and by the policy makers. The country continues to be characterized by a large agrarian base, with more than three quarters of the population living in rural areas and roughly 80 percent of this population are living directly off the land or from agriculture related activities. Small farmers in Bangladesh are struggling to compete in today's liberalized and globalised market place. This chapter will comment on importance of sustainable agricultural technologies for food security, environment and livelihood improvement in Bangladesh. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh ### Topics keywords: natural resource;drought stress;land degradation;SA;soil fertility;willingness pay;contract farming;chemical fertilizer;CF;sustainable agriculture;policy maker;DM;LD;natural disaster;decision making;animal health;rural area;food security;cover crop;climate change;crop insurance;CC ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2013,,"Multifunctional Agriculture, Ecology and Food Security: International Perspectives",,,,,,,#36853,,"",Observational
Sustainable agriculture system: production in socio-cultural and resource base.,"","Abstract: This study examines the models of sustainable farming in Thailand. A study was conducted from October 2002 to June 2004 on 32 northeastern Thai farmers in the three districts of Yasothon, namely Gudchum, Saimun and Muang. The sustainable farming models are classified into five types: (1) the paddy farm model; (2) the paddy and tree farm model; (3) the paddy, field crop and cattle farm model; (4) the paddy, field crop and cattle-concentrated vegetable farm model; and (5) the paddy and field-crop concentrated cattle farm model. The paddy farm model was most favoured. While the models have similar farming systems, they vary in six aspects: (1) suitability of the resource base; (2) production skill; (3) labour and machine of the family base; (4) marketing experience of the family base; (5) location and transportation in the village base; and (6) influence of the group in decision-making. Each farm model has eight production activities: (1) rice growing; (2) crop-before-rice and crop-after-rice growing; (3) herbal growing; (4) tree growing; (5) animal raising; (6) fish raising; (7) soil fertility management; and (8) water management. The integration of these complementary activities promotes sustainable farming. Thus, farmers have to be conscious of the management, complementarity and diversity of their farms. Management covers three factors: (1) using an activity's by-product that is related to another; (2) distributing resources such as land, labour, money and time in an integrated farm; and (3) distributing risk in farming. If farmers mismanage the diversity and integration of production, conflict instead of complementarity will arise. Furthermore, if they mismanage their work and the time devoted to their farm and community activities, conflicts will surface amongst themselves or within their family. ### Countries mentioned: Taiwan;Thailand ### Plant products search: rice;vegetables ### Animal products search: fish ### Topics keywords: paddy field;drought stress;SA;soil fertility;decision making;farming system;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2006,,"Kasetsart Journal, Social Sciences",,,,,,,#36712,,"",Observational
Sustainable management of natural resources in African and Asian mountains,"","Abstract: African and Asian mountains and highlands are ecoregions of particular importance for sustainable development due to their intensive land-use systems, their generally low economic productivity and integration, and the increasing rates of land degradation and mountain hazards. Opportunities for sustainable development exist, if ways to overcome land degradation can be found. The percentage of people who are engaged in subsistence agriculture can be reduced in favor of the secondary and tertiary sectors, protected areas can be better managed, access to remote areas improved, mountain waters utilized in a more integrated highland-lowland interaction, and mechanisms to manage conflicts developed. Research in support of sustainable development needs to focus on transdisciplinary approaches in order to develop appropriate technologies, improve land-management systems, and most importantly, create an enabling institutional environment. International cooperation is an essential tool for exchanging and communicating successful experiences from the local level to regional levels. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;sustainable development;land degradation;land use;LD;protected area",1999,,Ambio,,,,,,,#36642,,"",Observational
Sustainable utilization of poor acid soils of tropical America.,"","Abstract: Tropical America's 800 million hectares of savannas and forests are characterized by the predominance of acid Oxisols and Ultisols with low fertility. These soils are being incorporated into the region's agricultural production area. Land clearing and intensification of areas close to infrastructure cause the degradation of natural resources. There is a need to develop higher-yielding sustainable production systems. Strategies to reduce pressures for land-clearing in fragile environments include the development of sustainable agropastoral production systems for less fragile savanna environments and the reclamation of already degraded forest lands by the replacement of extensive ranching and shifting cultivation with sustainable agrosivilvopastoral systems. To achieve these specific strategies, it is necessary to promote efficient input use based on adapted components; low-cost management to maximize outputs and effectively use natural and purchased inputs in minimizing negative environmental effects; and maximizing nutrient cycling. To realize the potential of these sustainable integrated systems on poor acid soils, technologies must be based on commercially valuable, ecologically compatible, adapted components. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;arable land;million hectare;land degradation;land use;shifting cultivation;agroforestry system",1991,,Tropical Agriculture Research Series,,,,,,,#37577,,"",Observational
"Sustaining livelihoods under a changing climate: the case of urban agriculture in Lusaka, Zambia.","","Abstract: With rapidly deteriorating national and local economies, many urban dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are increasingly resorting to a wide range of informal sector activities to ameliorate food insecurity and generate household income. Among these activities is urban agriculture (UA), which is used both as a source of basic foodstuffs and income generation to enable access to a wide range of goods and services. These may include health care, education, clothing, food and housing. Despite its significance and contribution to the urban household food basket, UA in many SSA cities has not been integrated into urban development and planning policy. In addition to the absence of a supportive local government policy, over the last two decades UA has come under increasing pressure from extreme weather related events such as droughts and flooding. Drawing upon recent field-based research in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, the paper examines the relationships between UA and extreme weather conditions, and the impact on the livelihood options of urban poor. The research has wider relevance in the context of evolving strategies for achieving sustainable urban livelihoods, poverty reduction and food security in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. ### Countries mentioned: Zambia ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;health care;dairy farming;developing country;SSA;household food insecurity;human health;rural household;growing season;household food security;poverty reduction;wide range;weather condition;household income;pest control;smallholder farmer;management practice;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2012,,Journal of Environmental Planning and Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2011.637688,,#36750,,"",Observational
System and characteristics of mixed cropping in the tropics.,"","Abstract: Mixed cropping is commonly practised in tropical agriculture, particularly in smallholder farming. Crops of different lengths in the cycle of vegetation are planted on the same plot of land at different times of the year. In most cases, mixed stands are systematically established and maintained. Traditional farmers argue in favour of mixed cropping for the following reasons: (1) higher total return per acre; (2) reduced risks, due to disease and drought; (3) even supply of food to the household. Reduced need for storing facilities; (4) lower labour input per unit of total output (within hoe-farming); (5) reduction of soil erosion. It is, however, top difficult to bring into harmony mixed cropping and the introduction of improved farming practices; optimum time of planting, proper spacing, specific fertilizer application, etc. Furthermore, it is expensive to combine mixed cropping and mechanization. Consequently, with the increase in agricultural development mixed cropping is losing in importance. It is, however, not likely that mixed cropping will cease to exist. Where there is land shortage and ample supply of labour, different forms of mixed cropping, of phased planting and overlapping cycles of vegetation seem to be compatible with improved farming, provided row cultivation is practised.

System failure? Revisiting the problems of timely response to crises in the Horn of Africa.,"","Abstract: Humanitarian response to crises (e.g. droughts) in pastoral areas in the Horn of Africa has consistently been late, despite an enormous investment in early warning. Attempts to improve early response focus on improving the performance of one or two actors, or introducing new tools. Such approaches are needed, but they are not enough: what is needed is an overhaul of the response system as a whole. The present paper sets out three ideas for moving forward: a new framework for livelihoods programming and contingency planning; a new approach to preparedness; and a new conceptual framework for thinking about the response system as a whole. ### Topics keywords: contract farming;value chain;decision making",2011,,"HPN Network Paper - Humanitarian Practice Network, Overseas Development Institute",,,,,,,#36849,,"",Observational
Taking full advantage of the production potential in agriculture.,"","Abstract: The first section considers how far agriculture can lead the Polish economy out of the crisis. One of the major problems is the functioning of the domestic market. Agriculture can help, but only in conjunction with the food industries, and by reducing waste and losses throughout the food production cycle. Increased agricultural output could also help ease the balance of payments problem. However, the role of agriculture in overcoming the economic crisis is exaggerated. The next section considers the production potential of agriculture. Expansion of farm input industries, development of the food industries, and a radical change in the structure of peasant farming are needed to bring about concentration and specialization. Perhaps most important is to make use of existing potential. The third section considers the effectiveness of the production potential: during the 1970s increased potential was not matched by increased production. The fourth section considers agricultural policy: the state has a role to play, firstly by creating the necessary conditions such as an improved water supply or technical infrastructure, and secondly by using economic mechanisms and regulating the sale of inputs. This would eventually eliminate less effective producers. The last section looks at necessary conditions for increased effectiveness. Economic reform is required in agriculture and the whole economy, although this would lead to other problems. Only if agricultural producers respond rationally to the change will it be effective, which demands fundamental socio-political and economic change. ### Topics keywords: agro food;food insecurity;factor influencing",1981,,Wies Wspolczesna,,,,,,,#37281,,"",Observational

BRAVENBOER (pp. 641-646) in ' Soil disinfection with fumigants in glasshouse tomatoes' observed that chloropicrin, when applied to soil by motor injector or by hand in autumn in the Netherlands, not only controlled soil-borne tomato corky root [37, p. 739] and wilt, but also stimulated plant growth, probably as a result of the increase of bacterial population and N-mineralization level in treated soil. DD and ethylene bromide also stimulated growth [cf. 35, p. 727]. In his review of resistance problems in the genus and possibilities of their solution by breeding intra- and inter-sectional combinations, R. BAUER (pp. 685-696) reported [in German] that resistance of gooseberries and red and black currants to , and , respectively, was achieved by crosses involving 46 spp. of the sections Grossularia, Ribesia, and Coreosma. Crosses between gooseberry and mildew-resistant selections of gave mildew-free large-fruited forms highly resistant to other diseases. Similarly, black currant × gave promising seedlings combining resistance to and . Inter-sectional crosses of the more resistant vars. were also successful but often resulted in sterile hybrids, but with colchicine treatment these produced fertile amphidiploids. Virus infection may be avoided by using seed from selfed amphidiploids. Experimental results of the reactions of and to infection by are described by M. ZWINTSCHER (pp. 716-734) [in German]; 29 vars. of sour cherry, 11 clones of sweet and sour cherry, 4 standard vars., and 268 seedlings were tested with strain M4 of [35, p. 897; 36, p. 197] isolated from Schatten Morelle, the most important var. commercially, and the most susceptible. There is a seasonal change in susceptibility. The decreasing order of susceptibility in cherries is sour, Duke, and sweet; the respective symptoms produced under similar conditions were death of twigs above inoculation wounds, death of some buds near the wound, and gummosis only, due to liquefaction of infected tissue bordering healthy. Work done by J. R. SHAY, D. F. DAYTON, L. F. HOUGH, E. B. WILLIAMS, &amp; J. JANICK (pp. 735-739) on ' Apple scab resistance' at Purdue University, Indiana, involved the incorporation of major dominant genes for field immunity from [35, p. 829] in a number of Asiatic spp. by modified backcrossing [35, p. 419; 36, p. 192]. So far 3 genes for virulence in natural strains have been defined [36, p. 767]. D. STANKOVIC &amp; A. BECAREVIC (pp. 786-795), reporting from Yugoslavia on ' The study of P metabolism in healthy and diseased fruit trees, determined by radioactive P', found that P was best applied to trees as leaf sprays, by which it was most efficiently distributed through the plant via the xylem (which had the highest P content). Small amounts of B stimulated P uptake via the roots; , and increased P metabolism in the leaves of peach, apple, and cherry, respectively, while mosaic virus increased its metabolism in Italian plum, everywhere except the fruit. Dealing with ' Virus diseases of fruit trees, notes on identification and methods of checking spread', J. D. ATKINSON (pp. 800-804) stated that the presence of plum mosaic could be inferred in either scion or stock from their total incompatibility on 4 vars. of Japanese plum [36, p. 705] or partially on some apricot vars. Elimination of plum mosaic was achieved within 3 yr. in 1 orchard by roguing and selection of healthy budwood. Cross protection against apple mosaic, of which more than 1 strain occurs in New Zealand, is provided by bud failure if affected wood is used for budding. Stony pit of pear [37, pp. 90, 487] did not appear in healthy trees until 2 seasons after grafting with infected scions. Information from C. H. CADMAN (pp. 805-809) on 'Ringspot virus diseases of raspberries' has been noticed [35, p. 618; 37, p. 200]. In 'Contribution a 1'etude de 1' en Serres a vignes' R. DELHAYE (pp. 810-818) reports that the fungus, from disinfected pieces of rhizomorph, grew best on oatmeal in water. grew and sporulated best on celery leaf extract and on sterilized peat; agitating culture flasks checked its growth. No practical method was found for controlling on vine by , but brushing longer roots with 1% organo-mercuric salt solution and spraying the soil with 0.5% at 10 l./sq. m., or spraying soil with a solution of neutral o-oxyquinoline sulfate (200 p.p.m.) at 10 l./sq. m. 3 times at monthly intervals are recommended. H. REICH (pp. 819-826) discussed [in German] the advantages and disadvantages of important organic fungicides for the control of on apple [V. ] and pear [V. ]. H. J. WEZENBERG (pp. 970-978), dealing with 'Mineral deficiencies in flori-cultural crops at Aalsmeer', Netherlands, stated that most are due to a lack of trace elements. Mn and Fe deficiencies occur in roses and chrysanthemums; lowering the pH prevents these, and also Mn deficiency in lilac. Mg deficiency in lilac planted in a thin layer of black earth on acid clay can be corrected by increasing the black earth layer. is occasionally affected by a dying of the terminal buds, probably induced by Cu deficiency. E. HELLMERS states in' Bacterial wilt of carnations and its control' (pp. 985-994) that the method of obtaining cuttings free from [34, p. 525] is now used commercially on a large scale in Denmark in 2 nurseries. G. SCHOLTEN, dealing with ' Wilting diseases of carnations in the Netherlands' (pp. 995-1, 002), states that with improved growing conditions stem rot (mostly ) no longer causes much damage. [cf. 37, p. 481] is no longer a serious problem, the varieties commonly grown being only slightly susceptible. Control of the vascular diseases caused by [loc. cit.] and bacteria ( and a species of ) [cf. 36, p. 31] remains a problem; steam sterilization does not kill all the pathogens present in the soil at a depth of more than 30-50 cm., and the 2nd year after treatment wilting may have become so severe that carnation growing is no longer profitable. It is legally forbidden in the Netherlands to sell cuttings from greenhouses where vaseular diseases are known to be present, and the premises of all firms growing cuttings and young plants for the trade are regularly inspected. In a paper [in German] (pp. 1, 008-1, 018) on the disinfection of flower bulbs and corms from the Laboratorium fur Gärtnerischen Pflanzenbau, Kiel-Kitzeberg, H. PAPE gives the results of tests. Hot water disinfection (43.5° C., 30 min. with no plant damage) was found to be suitable for gladioli against . Formalin proved effective for gladioli, 4% for 1/2 hr. against or 3/4 hr. against , and ; for tulips 0.25 and 04%, 1 hr. against , or 0.4%, 1-8 hr. against ; and for narcissi, 04%, 1 hr. against and . If the temp, of the formalin was raised to 43.5° tulips treated with 0.5% for 1 hr. suffered damage, whereas narcissi were only damaged after 3 hr. or with 1% for 1-3 hr. Mercuric chloride at 0.1% was tested only on gladioli and was successful at 2 hr. against and var. , 2-14 hr. against the latter, 2-8 hr. against , 2-12 hr. against , 2-17 hr. against core rot ( sp. and . spp.), but only 2-3 hr. on scaled corms. Many gladiolus vars., however, are sensitive to HgCl. Ceresan wet was successful at 0.25%, 8-18°, for 1/21 hr. for tulips against ; for gladioli against , and S. ', for narcissi against ; and at 0.1%, 43.5° for 3.5 hr. for simultaneous disinfection against and . basal rot; in general 0.25%, 18°, for 1 hr. is recommended. Results with germisan wet were similar to those with ceresan, except that where damage did occur, particularly at higher conc., it was somewhat less severe. Only a few tests were made on gladioli with the Dutch Hg preparations bloembol-lengermisan (satisfactory at 0.25%, 16-17°, for 1-4 hr.) and AA bulba (good results on gladioli and narcissi). At 0.1%, 43.5°, for 2-4 hr. no damage was caused by AA bulba but at 0.25%, 43.5°, for 3-4 hr. narcissi and gladioli suffered some damage. At 4 hr. narcissi produced numerous sterile flowers. Of the dry disinfectants, tritisan and AA tiram were not harmful in diluted form to gladioli, tulips, or narcissi and should be used at 5 g./250 g. bulbs or corms. Brassicol, too, did not damage gladioli or narcissi. M. L. DUFRENOY &amp; J. DUFRÉNOY discussed [in French] (pp. 1, 019-1, 022) historical aspects of tulip breaking virus disease and ' parrot' tulips. F. G. MEYER, E. A. BENEDICT, &amp; G. KOCH reviewed (pp. 1, 235-1, 238) the 'Use of antibiotics in control of ornamental plant diseases'. D. MULDER, C. A. E. MEYNECKE, &amp; J. FLOOR describe (pp. 1, 239-1, 242) 'Indexing rootstocks and graftwood of apple for the presence of the ' rubbery wood' virus disease by using the variety Lord Lambourne' [cf. 35, p. 374, ]. The presence of the disease was determined (1) by bending 2-year-old stems and (2) by testing the wood with phloroglucin for lignin reaction at 3 different levels of the stem. The discrepancy between the results of the 2 methods was considerable, especially with the weaker rootstocks, with which the bending method gave almost the total number of affected trees, whereas with strong ones it gave a lower number than the colour method. The bending method should be discarded. None of the sources of graftwood of Golden Delicious was free from the virus. Some of the results given by P. PRÉVOT and M. OLLAGNIER [in French] (pp. 1, 382-1, 397) of surveys for mineral deficiencies in oil palm in Dahomey, Ivory Coast, and French Congo and in groundnut in Senegal have been noticed [37, p. 733]; also of Mn toxicity in groundnut in the French Congo. J. P. LAOH reports (pp. 1, 403-1, 408) 'Observations on the spraying and dusting of copper fungicides against blister blight ( Massee) in tea' [cf. 35, p. 239] in Indonesia. Both 4% Cu dust and Shell Cu naphthenic acid were satisfactory and controlled shoot infection at 450 ft. The interval between 2 sprays (10-12 days) was twice as long as for the dust, and the amount of Cu/ha. (40 g./10 1. spray/acre) was much lower for the spray. The quality of the tea from the sprayed area was poor. Cu naphthenic acid compounds are not at present suitable for use on tea. D. TOLLNAAR'S paper (pp. 1409-1411) on the control of on banana has been noticed [34, p. 381]. I. REICHERT gives (pp. 1, 413-1, 422) 'New light on xyloporosis and tristeza virus diseases' [cf. 36, pp. 23, 317], noting certain environmental and genetical factors which affect the symptoms. Regret is expressed that those who have studied tristeza disease have not provided details of the precise environmental conditions in which their experiments were conducted. A planned, international, co-operative project is required. Describing 'Breeding of stocks for citrus resistant to gum-disease and mal tristeza', H. J. TOXOPEUS states (pp. 1, 423-1, 427) that cuttings of 4 healthy stocks from Java apparently highly resistant to gum disease [15, p. 364; , p. 131] are now growing in the glasshouses of the Laboratory of Tropical Agriculture, Wageningen. A description, illustrated with 4 coloured plates, of' The major causes of die-back of citrus in Indonesia and their control' is given (pp. 1, 485-1, 500) by J. REITSMA and T. HADIWIDJAJA. Most forms of die-back would not occur, or only sporadically, if cultural conditions were correct. One of the principal causes of root rot is the decay induced by poor soil conditions. Bach tree needs 20-30 kg. of farmyard manure when planted and on poor soils up to 300 kg. afterwards. Chlorosis and die-back appear to be due primarily to deficiencies of Zn, Fe, and Mn. A Zn + Fe spray should be given in the nursery and continued as a routine in the young groves; the 1st field application should be given 3 months after transplanting and the next as soon as the flush starts, and repeated every 2 weeks during growth and with each new flush. A report is given (pp. 1531-1647) of the International Conference on the improvement of vegetable vars. held at Wageningen on 26-27 Aug. 1955. Dealing with trends in the development of new vegetable vars., 0. BANGA summarizes in tabular form the vars. grown in the different countries and the diseases to which they are resistant.

SWOT analysis on wheat production in the Huai River region in Anhui Province.,"","Abstract: SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) method was adopted to analyze factors affecting wheat production in Huai River region in Anhui. Its strengths were highlighted by the advantages in a large production scale and high yield potential, in a combination of natural resources in light, heat, water and soil suitable for wheat growth, and in a developed industrial standard. The disadvantageous factors included the frequent natural disasters and inadequate technological involvement in wheat production. Opportunities favoring wheat production and industrial development emerged from the Food Security Strategy stressed by the slate and an increasing investment into technology. Threats lay in difficulties in increasing yield per unit continuously, in increasing damages caused by natural disasters, pests and diseases, and in poorly educated farmer participants. On the basis of the above analyses, approaches and strategies were proposed with objective of promoting wheat production and scientific involvement in Huai River region. These solutions included implementation of policies with farmers as beneficiary, amelioration of conditions for wheat production, improvement of the comprehensive production ability, furthering the Project of S &amp; T for Grain Harvest aiming at increasing wheat yield potential with science and technology integrated, increase of the economic benefits by producing and processing high quality wheat products, and emphasizing the leading roles of the key farms in this region in demonstration and dissemination. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Plant products search: grain;wheat ### Topics keywords: natural resource;crop insurance;natural disaster;economic benefit;factor affecting;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2011,,Chinese Seed,,,,,,,#36516,,"",Observational
Synthetic organic water contaminants in developing communities: an overlooked challenge addressed by adsorption with locally generated char,"","Abstract: Chemical contamination of drinking water sources is a worldwide problem. However, few locally managed, sustainable, and low-cost on-site treatment technologies are available in rural, remote, and emergency/disaster relief/humanitarian crisis situations. Char filter-adsorbers have been used to treat drinking water for thousands of years and are still widely used today. Our studies show that some chars produced by traditional means from a range of feedstocks develop favorable sorption properties for uptake of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a prevalent herbicide and water contaminant. However, more energy efficient, environmentally sustainable and scalable production of consistent highly sorptive chars can be accomplished with biomass gasification. Our laboratory studies demonstrate that locally produced char adsorbents derived from surplus agricultural and forestry biomass are effective for adsorbing 2,4-D. A year-long study of field-scale application of chars in Thailand is also presented. Based on these studies we present design recommendations for integrating char adsorbers into low-cost, multi-barrier treatment trains for on-site water provision. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Measurements for interventions: herbicide ### Topics keywords: crop insurance;medicinal plant;drinking water ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2014,,JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2166/washdev.2014.073,,#37405,,"",Observational
Taking trouble over the home and the property: the house and the organization of property in family farming.,"","Abstract: This project manual was developed by the Family Farming Housing Cooperative (COOHAF) in association with the Federation of Agricultural Workers of Rio Grande do Sul (FETAG-RS) as a blueprint for technical and social projects aiming to raise the quality of rural life by improving the homes of farming families in the Rio Grande do Sul region of Brazil. Other partners associated with the project included the Rio Grande do Sul Association of Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Agencies (EMATER/RS) and the Sul Credit and Rural Assistance Association (ASCAR). Details are given of the 4 stages of the project. The first stage sets out the context of the project whose aims are the construction of dwelling units in Rio Grande do Sul and the implementation of actions for social sustainability relative to the homes and the production activities of family farmers. The objectives of the first stage as stated are: (1) to provide an opportunity for the formation and capacity building of the beneficiaries of the programme, and (2) to provide basic information on sources of resources and finance, and the importance of completing the programme. The 2nd stage deals with the social aspects of housing, providing information on self-assessment, cooperativization and unionization. The 3rd stage deals with homes and the organization of property, covering practical aspects such as the environment around the house (natural vegetation, the garden, the property's landscape), the organization of spaces and installations (growing vegetables, medicinal plants and fruits, rearing livestock (chickens for eggs and meat) and auxiliary installations such as sanitary facilities, produce stores and sheds) and the importance of sanitary facilities (protection of water sources, water use, filtration and treatment, fate of human wastes). The final stage of the project evaluates productivity and economic viability (analysis, organization of production, marketing). ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: fruits;vegetables ### Animal products search: poultry meat;eggs ### Programs found: stage project;completion program;farming project;beneficial program;beneficiary program;social project ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;medicinal plant;RS;rice straw;GIS;technical assistance;family farming ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2007,,Caprichando a moradia e a propriedade: a casa e a organização da propriedade na agricultura familiar,,,,,,,#37172,,"",Observational
Technical and economic profile of production of irrigated coconut in state of Ceará.,"","Abstract: This study aimed to identify the technical and economic profile of coconut production in the irrigation area of Distrito de Irrigação Curu-Paraipaba, in state of Ceará, Brazil. The importance of this study is due to the fact that the referred project of irrigation has existed for over three decades and currently has about 679 rural establishments managed by small producers. This study used a sample size equal to 50, and as tools of analysis, the study used descriptive and tabular analysis of the collected data, besides the techniques of factor and cluster analysis. It was reported that all establishments showed positive gross and net margin, but the level of income earned was considered low, taking as reference the variable profit. Then technical and economic factors were identified. When the factor scores were got, three groups of rural producers were identified; thus, this demonstrated differences at the technical and economic level between the family farmers interviewed. It was understood that the small producers interviewed have difficulty regarding working capital to operate their agricultural practices, and that their access to lines of credit, such as Pronaf, could be an economically important alternative. The access to rural credit is made difficult when the producers do not have the deed documents of the properties, so the main suggestion of a public policy to the Curu-Paraipaba project is the implementation of an extensive process of land regularization, without cost to the irrigation farmers that originated from there. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: coconuts ### Programs found: public policy curu paraipaba project ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;spatial distribution;public policy;trace element;CA;cluster analysis;family farming ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2014,,Revista de Politica Agricola,,,,,,,#36277,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-13 05:59:47)(Screen): What is the intervention?

Technical efficiency and environmental-technological gaps in wheat production in Kerman province of Iran [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: This article reports on an analysis of technical efficiency and environment-technology gaps in wheat farming in Iran. A random sample of 676 farmers was selected from the province of Kerman in 2004. In this study, Kerman is divided into five regions based on climatic and geographical conditions. The province is situated in the south-eastern part of Iran and contains substantial variations in climate. The technical efficiency indices are computed using three approaches. First, a standard stochastic production frontier was employed using pooled cross-sectional data. Secondly, regional stochastic frontier production functions were estimated. Lastly, the metafrontier approach was used because production environments and technologies are expected to differ between the five regions. Use of this method enabled technical efficiency scores to be corrected by the coefficient of the environment-technology gap ratio (ETGR). Estimates of the frontier were obtained assuming a translog functional form. Results indicate that farms differ in technical efficiencies, ETGRs and the use they make of inputs. Mean ETGRs vary substantially between farms and across regions whereas mean technical efficiencies are reasonably similar across regions but differ in the extent of variation among farms within each region. A low ETGR for the north-western region is attributable to a lack of water resources, restricting the ability of farmers to benefit from improved varieties, and small-sized farms, which militate against mechanization embodying labor-saving technologies. The results do not lead to definitive policy prescriptions. But they do provide indicators of where farm-level research is likely to be most effective in closing the environment-technology gap, for example by enabling farmers to take greater advantage of the productivity-enhancing effects of improved technologies embodied in cropping machinery and irrigation facilities. The ability of farmers to alleviate the environmental constraints on wheat production is likely to vary across regions, and will depend on the nature of these constraints and the ability of researchers to design technologies suited to each region that will overcome them. ### Countries mentioned: Iran ### Plant products search: wheat ### Topics keywords: stochastic frontier;insect pest;mean technical efficiency;dairy farming;stochastic frontier production;technical efficiency ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2008,,Agricultural economics the journal of the International Association of Agricultural Economists,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND43992824&site=ehost-live,,#37615,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-13 05:57:22)(Screen): No intervention examined.; ,Observational
"Technical, environmental and economic factors.","","Abstract: The purpose of this section (Part III) of the Seminar was to analyze the effects of the physical environment and the state and availability of technology, since choice and design of institutions is vitally affected by them. Four main types of environment and technology are covered. The first group of papers concerns pastoral organization (H.E. Jahnke and H. Ruthenberg, R. Baker, M.E. Adams, B. Thomson and G. Hunter, N.S. Jodha). A second group deals with irrigated agriculture (D.S. Thornton, J.B. Downs and N. Mountstephens, J.F. Cunningham). A third environment - the mixture of forestry and agriculture (L. Roche) - and a fourth - dry-land mixed farming in N. Nigeria (D.W. Norman) - are each dealt with in single papers. Two other main papers deal with subject areas rather than environment - the economics and distribution of economic benefits in cereal production in a small-holder economy (J.W. Mellor) and the relevance and applicability of research (B.N. Okigbo). The opening address on this subject, by J.O. Akinmolemiwa, provided a wide-ranging review of the varieties of environmental and technical requirements in Nigerian agriculture and of many different types of organization which have been evolved by the Nigerian government to deal with them. The paper by Jahnke and Ruthenberg, extracts from papers by Adams and Baker, Thornton's survey of alternatives in the organization of irrigation, the paper on research by Okigbo, and Norman's paper are printed in full, and the remainder are summarized. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;United States ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: irrigated agriculture;water saving;NH4;mixed farming;economic benefit;NO3;farming system;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1976,,"Policy and practice in rural development.

Techniques for nitrogen management in municipal solid waste composting,"","Abstract: Though it has been around for centuries, composting is becoming increasingly important today in research and in practice for its environmental benefits. Nitrogen plays a central role in the composting process and in many of the applications of compost, but despite the relevance of this topic it has not been thoroughly studied in municipal solid waste (MSW) composting. Improved management of nitrogen in compost could benefit water quality, in areas suffering from non-point nutrient runoff due to conventional fertilizers; waste management, for the organic fraction of the municipal waste stream; and agriculture, for which compost is currently too nutrient-poor to be commercially viable as fertilizer on a large scale. In this project, possible methods for engineering the MSW composting process to yield a product richer in organic nitrogen have been identified through tests in aerated, pilot-scale reactors. Compost batches run with traditional methods tended to yield a product that was low in organic nitrogen, with high nitrogen losses often observed. These results were consistent with previous research that has shown traditional MSW compost to be relatively poor for agricultural use. However, some of the process modifications were successful in conserving organic nitrogen. These included (1) the inclusion of shredded office paper as a feedstock, (2) the collection of compost leachate, and (3) the addition of strong acid or acid-loaded clay. The results of this study suggest future experiments to develop methods for producing better MSW compost. ### Programs found: large scale (LIS) project;scale project ### Topics keywords: anaerobic digestion;large scale;biogas production",2010,,World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010: Challenges of Change - Proceedings of the World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2010,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1061/41114(371)57,,#36799,,"",Observational
Technological change and rural poverty in Pakistan. A study of the consequences for employment and the economic situation in villages in the Punjab.,"","Abstract: The long-term consequences of technological change in agriculture on the living and working conditions of the rural poor in the Pakistan Punjab are investigated. Employment patterns and income adjustments among small farmers, tenants and rural workers are analyzed, and rural processes of adjustment to technological change, and adaptation to a changing social environment are identified. Technological change implies new approaches to fertilizers, pesticides, seed varieties, and water management, as well as mechanization of field operations such as ploughing, irrigation and harvesting. On the basis of household and farm data collected during 1962 and 1968 surveys in the Punjab, a comparative static analysis was carried out to measure the long-term employment and economic effects on three village environments, namely small farmer, landlord and surburban village. Structural changes and the population's adaptation to them were evaluated at village level and in terms of occupational groups. Village studies were complemented by descriptions of Pakistan's economic and agricultural development. Study findings showed that the traditional living conditions of the rural poor had deteriorated, although this was due less to technological changes and more to the agrarian conditions and social structure under which the changes were introduced. Industrialization and economy-wide structural change negatively affected rural living conditions, although non-agricultural employment opportunities had increased chances for younger generations to improve rural incomes. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan ### Topics keywords: structural change;arable land;living condition;rural household;dairy industry;rural poverty;employment opportunity;factor influencing;rural area;long term ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1986,,Sozialökonomische Schriften zur Ruralen Entwicklung,,,,,,,#37377,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-13 05:52:40)(Screen): Outcomes are village level not on-farm incomes or yields.

Technology transfer for small farmers: the Malaysian experience.,"","Abstract: Efforts at improving the quality of life of small farmers in Malaysia needs to be directed towards increasing the productivity of the smallholder sub-sector. In line with the National Agricultural Policy formulated in 1984, productivity among smallholders will be stepped up through effective extension programmes. Agricultural extension programmes can be classified under three broad categories: Farm Improvement Programme, Rural Youth Programme and Farm Family Development Programme. Group farming projects have recently been introduced, and have increased the adoption of improved technologies.

Temporal variability of two contrasting transient pollution events in a pastoral stream.,"","Abstract: Two transient pollution events were monitored in a pastoral stream in southwestern Kenya to evaluate their relative contribution to diffuse pollution. Peak loads of pollutants during storm-induced transients were within 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than the short-lived (30-60 minutes) diurnal episodes provoked by in-stream activities of people and livestock. Transient yields were striking during storm-induced events; 778,000, 8,400, 550 and 100 kg day for suspended solids, BOD, total P and total N, respectively, compared to wet weather base flow (150, 30, 0.8 and 1.4 kg day, for the same parameters, respectively). Two forms of concentration-discharge relationships were observed: increases in concentration for turbidity, suspended solids, BOD, total P and the faecal indicator bacteria at the peak of the stream hydrograph, and concurrent decreases in concentration for conductivity and total N. Following each storm-induced transient event, a marked improvement in water quality was observed within 48-72 hrs of the receding limb of the stream hydrograph before the next base low was established. It was concluded that storm-induced transients are exceedingly important for the mobilization of pollutants from diffuse sources but both transient events affect stream-channel processes, especially water quality, with the possibility of attendant consequences on the health of riparian inhabitants. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: BOD5;TN;COD;BOD;NH4;TP;SS;NO3;sewage sludge ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2010,,Water Science and Technology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2010.566,,#36787,,"",""
Teparies in southwestern North America - A biogeographical and ethnohistorical study of Phaseolus acutifolius,"","Abstract: Ethnohistorically, wild and domesticated teparies (Phaseolus acutifolius: Leguminosae) are significant native food crops in southwestern North America. Their value rests in adaptations to arid environments, and high protein content and productivity. Use of wild teparies appears to be discontinued, but certain domesticated varieties are still grown by local commercial and subsistence farmers. The recent subsidence of tepary cultivation is related to breakdown of traditional economies and land use, and to the introduction of energy-intensive irrigated agriculture. An earlier and unsuccessful attempt to introduce teparies into modern agriculture was poorly timed. Teparies have considerable potential for low maintenance agriculture in arid and semi-arid lands. ### Plant products search: phaseolus ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;protein content;irrigated agriculture;arable land;chemical composition;sustainable development;water saving;land use;agricultural machinery;pest control;modern agriculture;long term ### Geo regions: North America",1978,,Economic Botany,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02906725,,#37408,,"",""
The 2010 pastoral industry survey: Top End Region.,"","Abstract: The Top End is a small, diverse region of the Northern Territory (NT), which produces cattle predominantly for the live cattle export market to South-East Asia. The region has a semi-arid monsoonal climate with reliable wet and dry seasons. This comprehensive survey was conducted to record pastoral industry practices in 2010 as a follow up to the survey conducted in 2004. Twenty properties or pastoral business units in the Top End were surveyed out of 40. Only 17 (35%) of the properties used for pastoralism in the Top End are formal pastoral leases; the rest are a mixture of freehold land, Crown lease, grazing lease and Indigenous land. The surveyed properties varied in size from 44 km to 1285 km, with an average size of 497 km. Most of these properties utilised their land for grazing, but other enterprises were also conducted on them, such as hay production, horticulture and tourism. Most of the properties were either privately-owned with a hired manager (40%), or were run by an owner-manager (35%). The 20 properties had an average of 3600 head of cattle and six of them also had an average of 300 head of buffalo. All the properties had improved infrastructure in the last two years, spending an average of $344 000, mostly on subdividing paddocks and constructing staff accommodation. Some properties also developed water points and erected sheds. The aim of the majority of producers (75%) was to breed and sell animals mainly to the live export feeder cattle market. The other enterprises, such as agistment (10%) and growing/finishing cattle (15%) are also generally aimed at the same market. In 2010, 26 509 animals were turned off, predominantly to the live export market in South-East Asia. Cattle were sold during all months of the year. Producers had improved the efficiency of their enterprises through infrastructure development, such as constructing laneways (90%), subdividing paddocks and establishing water points. They had also improved the efficiency of their businesses by changing the way they used staff and used benchmarking. Some properties did not employ permanent staff in 2010, and those that did, employed fewer in comparison with 2004. The properties employed more seasonal staff in 2010 than in 2004 and helicopters were used more for mustering. Eighty per cent of producers now used financial and natural resources benchmarking to manage their businesses. There had also been changes to the way producers managed their cattle enterprises to improve efficiency and productivity. Average bull use dropped from 4% to 3.2% between 2004 and 2010, while the use of estimated breeding values (EBVs) to select bulls increased. More properties were culling cows based on age, pregnancy status, temperament and conformation. More producers in 2010 weaned at different weights according to conditions, and more fed weaners hay and/or concentrates. More producers were using rotational grazing, spelling and time control grazing in 2010 compared with 2004. Compared with 2004, in 2010 marketing issues and government regulations were cited more as hurdles to managing enterprises, while roads and access dropped slightly as hurdles, but continued to be important. Staff availability, weeds and cost of production were seen as lesser hurdles in 2010 than in 2004. Market access was the main issue to affect profitability, as it increased markedly in importance in 2010 compared with 2004. Government regulation and policy were also issues of increased importance. Cost of production dropped slightly as an issue in 2010, but remained important for profitability. The importance of weeds as a detriment to profitability dropped in 2010, but it was the main issue affecting environmental sustainability. ### Topics keywords: natural resource;sweet potato;factor affecting;developing country;survey conducted;dry season;agroforestry system;NT;small scale;value chain;dairy cattle;social capital;management practice;food insecurity;spatial distribution;crop residue;smallholder farmer;human activity;market access ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific",2014,,The 2010 pastoral industry survey: Top End Region,,,,,,,#36346,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-13 05:40:12)(Screen): Australia based study.; ,""
The arid steppe rangelands of Northern Africa.,"","Abstract: The steppes of Northern Africa, located between the annual isohyets of 100 and 400 mm, cover some 630 000 km between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. They are made of a low and sparse vegetation of perennial sub-shrubs and, occasionally, of perennial grass (esparto). The natural land use has been for centuries the nomadic grazing of sheep, goats and dromedaries, together with the shifting cultivation of cereals. This land use model worked out throughout the historical times until the mid-twentieth century in a globally stable society. At present, the main fact is the shrinking of the steppe areas and their occasionally extreme degradation. The consequence is that pastoral production from these rangelands has been characterized by a significant decline over the past five decades. Particularly quick and intense shifts took place under the growing pressure of population growth, which trebled over the past half-century in the five North African countries and increased nine-fold over the century. This population growth generated the expansion of cultivated land and a shift in land management practices which are exacerbated by the impact of more or less severe periodic droughts. It is, however, difficult to distinguish the long term trends from the temporary impact of interannual fluctuations that are revertible. The confusion between these two concepts fuels the debate. This debate is unclear because of the scant and often unreliable baseline data sources on preexisting situations and for long-term evolutions follow-up. Such data sources (vegetation description, functioning analyses, historical statistical figures, etc.) are on the increase. They lead to a more reliable assessment of the biodiversity and potential productivity of these ecosystems, under the prevalent interannual climatic variability. The objective of the present chapter is to present the current situation in the steppe environments, of their biodiversity, productivity and dynamics but also of livestock performance and of the overall impact of the incurring changes on geographic space, environment and people. We also identify possible remedies to the situation: exclosures, deferred grazing, restoration operations, rehabilitation, agroforestry and silvopastoralism, etc. If the sometimes anarchic utilization of steppe resources leads to profound changes in the environment, one should not, however, overgeneralize the established facts of progressing desertification. Some types of steppe keep a good enough level of resilience that makes their rehabilitation feasible under a rational management. It proves it is important to consider a hierarchical approach involving specialists from the various disciplines concerned (ecology, hydrology, agronomy, pastoralism, livestock husbandry, socioeconomic, etc.). ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;current situation;arable land;sustainable development;land degradation;water saving;land use;dairy industry;agricultural machinery;cultivated land;shifting cultivation;agroforestry system;economic benefit;management practice;beef cattle;rural area;long term;raw material ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa",2006,,Sécheresse,,,,,,,#36179,,"",""
The Asian Development Bank's role in Asian development.,"","Abstract: The need for Asian countries to export and the ambivalent nature of the ' Green Revolution ' is discussed. In order.to back up the ' Green Revolution ' most developing countries need to invest in fertilizers and irrigation. The Asian Development Bank is able to make loans for this purpose. It can also pay for the training of extension workers and can lend money to create rural credit banks. The case of Thailand is quoted where in the first five months of 1970 income from rice exports dropped $1.6 million, although 115, 000 tons more rice was exported than in the previous year. This drop was caused by a sharp drop in world market prices. In order to balance this effect of the surplus, Thailand is diversifying. For example a canning factory costing million is now in operation producing 6, 000 cans of pineapple, sweet corn and asparagus daily. This is to assist peasant rice farmers who previously could hope to earn only $10 per rai per year (3.5 rai = 1 acre); the prospect of $116 per rai per year is now offered by switching to this other product.

The Borzava mountain pastures in the Russian Carpathians.,"","Abstract: The alpine pastures of the Russian Carpathians, lying above the forest line, some 1, 200 metres above sea level, cover 107, 000 acres of land and afford pasturage for approximately 100, 000 animals from the end of May till the middle of October. These pastures, of which 82 per cent. belong to the State and are rented at a moderate rate, are of great importance to the many small farmers of the country, since climate and the nature of the land make cattle raising more profitable than arable farming. is the prevailing type of vegetation. Rainfall is heavy, but owing to the permeability of the soil there is as a rule no excess of moisture. Mountain streams provide watering for cattle. A detailed description of the botanical composition of these pastures, with special reference to agricultural requirements, is given. Efforts made by the Hungarian Government to improve the alpine pastures before the war, and since revived by the Czechoslovakian Government, have left the Borzava pastures as yet untouched; more cattle are grazed upon them than they can reasonably carry, to the detriment of both cattle and vegetation. The author emphasises the necessity for improvement, and suggests how this may best be effected. Particular importance is attached to the use of the Siemens-Schuckert cutter (Fräse K) for the eradication of , and attention is drawn to the successful experiments carried out with this implement in the Austrian Alps by Dr. Trubrig (, 1. 50. 1931).

The Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan: Pastoral Nomadism in Transition.,"","Abstract: This book describes the economic needs of Arab nomadic pastoralists and discusses their dependence upon the rural economy. The pastoralists in Qataghan settled in the area in the 1870's as part of the Russian development plan. They are specialists who raise sheep for sale; they depend upon agriculturalists for grain and upon manufactured goods from urban markets. The book describes their clan structure. The tribal structure of the Qataghan Arabs, which developed after they left the fixed districts of Bokhara, has become an obstacle to national administration in recent years. Now that organization and defense are managed by the central government, private property and a money economy is accelerating the loosening of tribal kinship structures.&lt;new para&gt;ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:&lt;new para&gt;The book presents an ethnographic description of the Central Asian Arabs, a little-known people of northeastern Afghanistan, and an account of the changes that have taken place in their way of life over the last 50 years. The Arabs, as referred to in the book, are nomadic pastoralists, seasonally moving from lowland river valleys to high mountain peaks. The study illustrates the wide-ranging complexity of pastoral nomadism, its integration into a regional economy and the structural changes within the pastoral economy itself. These changes contradict the argument that nomadic pastoralism is a specialization without potential for development. ### Countries mentioned: Afghanistan ### Plant products search: grain ### Topics keywords: structural change;arable land;rural community;rural household;dairy industry;rural tourism;factor influencing;rural development;rural area;rural economy ### Geo regions: South Asia;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1981,,The Central Asian Arabs of Afghanistan: Pastoral Nomadism in Transition.,,,,,,,#36766,,"",""
The challenge of seed production and supply in Africa,"","Abstract: Use of certified seed or indeed, improved seed in many African countries is largely restricted and limited to a few crops such as maize, and to a limited extent, imported vegetables. For other crops the majority of smallholder farmers in Africa use on-farm saved seed and in some cases, seed from relief agencies, and, therefore, the use of improved seed is correspondingly limited. The reasons for poor supply of improved seed include high cost (both real and perceived) of seed and associated inputs and the unreliability of returns. More importantly, administrative or institutional inadequacies limit both production and the supply of improved seed. These inadequacies (eg. seed monopolies that tend to limit private sector participation, lack of policy attention to 'minor' crops which are essential for seed security and hence, household food security) must be resolved through discussions involving both producers and users of seed. Due to lack of coherent seed policy in many of the African countries, seed insecurity and widespread food insecurity have become a widespread phenomenon. Besides structural rigidities, a number of regulations need to be reviewed and simplified. For example, variety and certification procedures are often cumbersome and expensive. Seed regulations also need to be harmonised across different countries to ease variety movement and in certain instances, seed imports. Seed information exchange is also needed among different seed experts in the continent on a number of issues including, for instance, the performance and potential suitability of newly developed and in certain cases, even local farmer developed varieties, rainfall patterns, etc. Seed quality control systems must be modified, and in some instances, simplified to reduce delays and costs, and ensure that certification standards are not excessively strict. These challenges could be faced squarely by establishing an international seed fund to finance regular seed policy reviews, seminars and seed networks, to provide support to emerging seed entrepreneurs such as individuals, family seed companies, NGOs, cooperatives, farmers' groups, and to improve the continent's capacity for seed policy formulation and implementation. It is a daunting task, but not insurmountable. ### Plant products search: maize;vegetables ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;household food insecurity;rural community;household food security;private sector;NGO;contract farming;smallholder farmer;food security",1999,,Seed Science and Technology,,,,,,,#37387,,"",""
The changing economic context of mixed farming in savanna West Africa: a conceptual framework applied to Burkina Faso,"","Abstract: Keeping cattle on smallholder farms has long been a major theme of agricultural development programs in tse-tse free parts of West Africa. Yet mixed farming technologies of this type remain rare in crop producing parts of the zone. The paper lays out a conceptual framework for understanding the economic rationality of this phenomenon, by exploring the interrelationships among the options available for using farm household productive resources in West Africa and the resource use impacts of different mixed farming practices involving cattle. A hypothetical case is made for the impact of changes in the relative values of specific primary factors on the relative attractiveness to farmers of specific mixed farming practices. The case is made more concrete by an application to Burkina Faso, where the relative opportunity costs to farmers of land, labor, and capital have evolved substantially in relation to each other since the late 1960's largely in response to macroeconomic developments in the entire West African region, but also in lesser measure to increased population density. It is concluded that rapid urban and coastal growth in the 1960's and 1970's had the impact of discouraging investments of farmers' time and money in mixed farming using cattle, especially animal traction. However, urban and coastal economic stagnation in the region during the 1980's was conducive to investments in mixed farming in general, and animal traction in particular. -from Author ### Countries mentioned: Burkina Faso ### Programs found: development program;agricultural development program (ADP);agriculture development program ### Topics keywords: organic farming;spatial distribution;land degradation;biological control;population density;protected area;mixed farming;human activity;farming practice;farming system;sustainable agriculture;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1989,,Quarterly Journal of International Agriculture,,,,,,,#36618,,"",""
The effects of climatic variations on agriculture in northeast Brazil.,"","Abstract: A simulation model, originally designed for the determination of best sowing dates, was used to estimate the effects on cowpea yields of several climatic situations, in 6 representative semi-arid municipalities. The climatic situations included combinations of 10% increases or decreases in rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Results indicated that yields could be &gt;60% below normal in extreme drought years. The trends over time in 1960-83 were examined for important food and non-food crops for different states in NE Brazil and the impacts of droughts, such as those of 1983 and 1978-1980, were considered. Food crop yields had been generally declining, with production increases obtained only by expanding the crop areas. Droughts caused further sharp reductions in yields, and in severe drought years, such as 1983, the crop area could also be reduced. The cultivation of and cassava was most effected by drought and small farmers were the most directly affected. The 1983 drought reduced the region's gross agricultural production by nearly 25%, reduced the region's contribution to national maize, and cotton production by about 50% and substantially reduced demand for a range of goods and services in the region. Attempts to apply multiple regression anaylsis to quantifying the effects of rainfall and trends over time on crop yields were not altogether successful. Recommendations included investigation of the feasibility of a 2-3 month warning of severe drought, the promotion and development of irrigation and the enhancement of education, employment opportunities and agricultural productivity amongst those most likely to be severly affected by drought. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: maize;cassava;stone fruits;cowpeas;cotton ### Measurements for crops: cotton ### Topics keywords: employment opportunity;food insecurity;rural area;NDVI ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1988,,The impact of climatic variations on agriculture.

The emerging oilseed crop sesamum indicum enters the “Omics” era,"","Abstract: Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the oldest oilseed crops widely grown in Africa and Asia for its high-quality nutritional seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments and constitutes an alternative cash crop for smallholders in developing countries. Despite its economic and nutritional importance, sesame is considered as an orphan crop because it has received very little attention from science. As a consequence, it lags behind the other major oil crops as far as genetic improvement is concerned. In recent years, the scenario has considerably changed with the decoding of the sesame nuclear genome leading to the development of various genomic resources including molecular markers, comprehensive genetic maps, high-quality transcriptome assemblies, web-based functional databases and diverse daft genome sequences. The availability of these tools in association with the discovery of candidate genes and quantitative trait locis for key agronomic traits including high oil content and quality, waterlogging and drought tolerance, disease resistance, cytoplasmic male sterility, high yield, pave the way to the development of some new strategies for sesame genetic improvement. As a result, sesame has graduated from an “orphan crop” to a “genomic resource-rich crop.” With the limited research teams working on sesame worldwide, more synergic efforts are needed to integrate these resources in sesame breeding for productivity upsurge, ensuring food security and improved livelihood in developing countries. This review retraces the evolution of sesame research by highlighting the recent advances in the “Omics” area and also critically discusses the future prospects for a further genetic improvement and a better expansion of this crop. ### Plant products search: sesame ### Topics keywords: ensuring food security;future prospect;genetic improvement;cover crop;developing country;drought stress;rural household;agricultural machinery;drought tolerance;cash crop;dairy cattle;sweet potato;farming system;food security",2017,,Frontiers in Plant Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2017.01154,,#37254,,"",""
Technology integration for profitable cashew nut cultivation in backward district of West Bengal.,"","Abstract: Over the years, India emerges as one of the important players in the global map of cashew nut cultivation. Changing food habits and increasing purchasing power of a section of population has created steady demand of cashew. With keeping in the mind Lodhasuli GP under West Midnapore district of West Bengal, was considered as the one of the area that can be benefitted to the livelihood security of poor from the intervention of cashew nut crop. The district is characterized with skewed distribution of rainfall which in absence of proper water harvesting structure runs-off quite fast creates permanent zone eroded soil and is not best for the agronomic crops. The remaining vast upland has the potentials to grow cashew. The cashew plantation in this area is quite old. The orchard management suffers from some of the common ills like poor care and management. The farmers have poor access to extension services and technology for improving productivity in the cashew orchard. We have undertaken intervention in cashew to improve the overall activity with the measures like rejuvenation of old orchard, intercropping to optimize land, market linkage, training on pest management and nutrient management. The intervention covered 124 numbers of farmers with an area of 25 hectare in the first year and another 21.5 hectare in the second year with 101 numbers of farmers. The economics of rejuvenation through proper management techniques have given the best be benefit cost ratio around 1:5 and again the Rs 536,322 of income have received with the farmers after properly intercropped the orchard with the pineapple and papaya. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: pineapples;papayas;cashews ### Topics keywords: rural household;cost ratio;extension service;net return ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,Environment and Ecology,,,,,,,#36674,,"",""
The acclimatization of European breeds of cattle in the tropics.,"","Abstract: FIJI lies at 18° S. latitude and has an av. annual rainfall of 116 in., and a mean annual t° of 76° F. with high humidity. As there are no indigenous cattle, European breeds have been imported from Australia and New Zealand, and the Indian Nellore breed from India and the U. S. A. In spite of the fact that Fiji lies within the tropics the imported European dairy breeds give a higher av. yield of milk than tropical [zebu] breeds, and this av. yield has been calculated to be 3/5 of the yield that would be given by the same cow in a temperate climate. In 1948 the recorded av. butterfat yield of 837 Jersey, Friesian, and grade cows owned by the Fiji Pastoral Company was 169. 5 1b. From this the av. yield of milk was calculated, on an av. butterfat content of 3. 7% for Friesian and 5% for Jersey milk, to be 4581 1b. The av. lactation period was 257 days. The yield of butterfat compares favourably with the av. Queensland figure of 160 1b. in 1945-46. The av. dressed carcass weight of all cattle slaughtered in abattoirs in Aug. 1949 was 507 1b. ; four-yr-old steers averaged approx. 600 1b., with a maximum of 1200 1b. The contention that European catule are unsuitable for milk production in the tropics is not considered to be applicable where all the factors limiting their successful acclimatisation do not operate. In Fiji there are no infectious diseases, nutrition and management are fairly good, and in fact European cattle will breed regularly, grow to the same size, and reach maturity at the same age as do cattle in temperate zones. European cattle have been found to be more profitable than Indian Nellore cattle. Therefore the selection of breeds with known high heat tolerance is recommended, and measures are suggested for improving the environment by good management and feeding. The possibility of developing a tropical dairy breed by crossbreeding is referred to, and the cross between Red Sindhi and Red Poll is suggested. The author concludes by stating that the harmful effects of high temperature and humidity in the tropics can be largely offset by good management. J. P.

The basis and structure of agriculture in Ceylon.,"","Abstract: Ceylon is a typical agrarian country, over 60 per cent. of its working population being engaged in agriculture. The level of literacy is high (80 per cent.), and education is good by comparison with other developing countries. However, practical farm extension work still meets many difficulties. Of the total area of 6.5 million ha., about 2.7 million are actively farmed. Permanent crops cover 37 per cent. of this area, of which coconut, rubber and tea represent 97 per cent. of the export. The basic food crop is rice, covering 530, 000 ha., although 40 per cent. of domestic consumption needs are imported. In livestock husbandry beef-cattle (1.5 million head) prevail. About 780, 000 water-buffalo are kept mainly as draught animals, protected by government measures against slaughtering, etc. In arid areas goats are the main source of meat. The farm structure is characterized by the extent of permanent cropping. About 50 per cent. of the area is under tea, while 26 per cent. of the rubber area comprises plantations over 500 acres. Some 80 per cent. of the coconut area consists of smallholdings. Paddy farms average from 2-4 acres. The land tenure situation is unclear and reliable data are not available. The total agricultural output is insufficient; yields from permanent and other crops vary greatly with the type of holding. As Ceylon will remain predominantly agricultural, efficiency must be increased. But despite government efforts to increase productivity through direct measures, the basic political situation seems unfavourable.

The climate-population nexus in the East African Horn: Emerging degradation trends in rangeland and pastoral livelihood zones,"","Abstract: Increasing climate variability and extreme weather conditions along with declining trends in both rainfall and temperature represent major risk factors affecting agricultural production and food security in many regions of the world. The rangelands of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the East African Horn remain one of the world's most food insecure regions, yet have substantially increasing human populations predominantly dependent on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods. We identify regions where substantial rainfall decrease between two periods interrupted by the 1998 El Nino event (1981-2012) in the East African Horn is coupled with human population density increases. Vegetation in this region is characterized by a variable mosaic of land covers, generally dominated by grasslands necessary for agro-pastoralism, interspersed by woody vegetation. Recent assessments indicate that vegetation degradation is occurring, adversely impacting fragile ecosystems and human livelihoods. Using AVHRR and MODIS vegetation products from 1981 to 2012, we observe changes in vegetation patterns and productivity over the last decade across the East African Horn. We observe vegetation browning trends in areas experiencing reduced main-growing season precipitation; these areas are also concurrently experiencing increasing population pressures. We also found that the drying precipitation patterns only partially statistically explain the vegetation browning trends, indicating that other factors such as population pressures and land use changes might be responsible for the observed declining vegetation condition. Furthermore, we show that the general vegetation browning trends persist even during years with normal rainfall conditions such as 2012, pointing to potential long-term degradation of rangelands on which approximately 10 million people depend. These findings may have implications for current and future regional food security monitoring and forecasting as well as for mitigation and adaptation strategies in a region where population is expected to continue increasing against a backdrop of drying climate trends and increased climatic variability. ### Countries mentioned: Somalia;Kenya;Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: adaptation strategy;last decade;LUC;biological control;factor affecting;land cover;point view;NDVI;weather condition;large scale;long term;land use change;population density;protected area;food insecure;climate variability;food security;food insecurity;MODIS;climate change;spatial distribution;land use;growing season;smallholder farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",2013,,Global Environmental Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.10.002,,#36426,,"",""
The clove tree of Madagascar : a success story with an unpredictable future,"","Abstract: The clove tree was introduced to Madagascar from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia at the beginning of the 19th century. In spite of its sensitivity to hazards such as cyclones, a locally found pest known as andretra and year-on-year variability in the production of cloves, it has adapted surprisingly well to the ecological conditions on Madagascar's East coast, particularly the Analanjirofo Region. The species was adopted very rapidly by farmers.(some settlers but mostly native peasant farmers), who integrated it into their cropping systems as a complement to their staple crops (rice, in particular) and cash crops (coffee and vanilla). Currently, the marketability of cloves brings a regular income to households, ensuring them food security. The clove tree bears two products of high economic value, the clove, which is the dried flower bud, and the essential oil, derived from distillation of the leaves, of which Madagascar is the world's number one exporter. Products from the clove tree, along with vanilla, account for the largest (second largest in some years) proportion of Madagascar's agricultural exports. Cloves are exported primarily to Indonesia to be used in the production of the local cigarettes known as kretek. There is a small demand from northern countries for exports of the clove spice. Clove essential oil is produced in a plethora of redimentary stills located throughout the clove growing zone. The quality of the essential oil depends on the content of eugenol, a molecule of interest in a number of commercial sectors including the cosmetic industry, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and the food industry. The clove tree in Madagascar seems to represent an example of successful adoption and integration of a new crop into existing production systems. However, the clove tree plantations are ageing and the conditions for their renewal are not fully established. Whilst the market for cloves is largely dependent on demand from Indonesia, the future looks promising for the world market in clove spices and eugenol-based products. Consequently, current practices and possible ways of adapting and developing the Malagasy clove sector in new directions need to be investigated and addressed in order to balance the future demands of the markets with the needs of the farmers in terms of resource management and valorization. ### Countries mentioned: Madagascar;Indonesia ### Plant products search: rice;cloves;clover;vanilla ### Topics keywords: ensuring food security;EO;cover crop;cropping system;rural household;essential oil;cash crop;sweet potato;farming system;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD",2014,,BOIS ET FORETS DES TROPIQUES,,,,,,,#36207,,"",""

The Common Agricultural Policy versus the peasant economy.,"","Abstract: The discrepancy between the CAP and farmers' economic rationality is illustrated. Tempered as it is by social considerations such as parity between farmers and other social categories, supplying consumers at reasonable prices, etc., economic liberalism is, nevertheless, the foundation of the Common Agricultural Policy, with its objective of transforming agriculture and establishing farms of sufficient size to integrate with other economic activities and better react to market conditions. This type of reasoning arises from industrial ideology, and is not applicable to the agricultural situation. In spite of undeniable internal changes, and considerable external pressure, the basic core of agriculture is still the family farm. Developments in recent years have not shown a trend towards the trio 'businessman, landowner, paid worker', but rather the reinforcement of the family nature of the farm through a reduction in the number of paid employees and the increasing importance of joint working of land. Contrary to the logic of sound industrial management (profit maximization), the peasant economy is essentially based on permanent adjustment of farm production possibilities, given available labour and the needs of the family. The symbiosis between unit of production and unit of consumption determines the economic, social and financial behaviour of farmers, and shows why an agricultural policy based on policies of neo-liberalism encounters so many difficulties in being applied. ### Programs found: coordinated agricultural project (CAP);central arizona project (CAP);caribbean amblyomma program (CAP);conservation agriculture (CA) program ### Topics keywords: family farming;CAP;decision making",1975,,Reflets et Perspectives de la Vie Economique,,,,,,,#36623,,"",""
"The conservation value of oil palm plantation estates, smallholdings and logged peat swamp forest for birds","","Abstract: The expansion of industrial oil palm cultivation threatens tropical biodiversity globally, especially in developing countries. Driven by plans to generate economic revenue, large-scale plantations are emerging in Southeast Asia, Africa and Brazilian Amazon. However, the ecological impacts of the sector are poorly studied with respect to oil palm management system, and recommended conservation measures are based on limited data. We studied avifauna in oil palm landscapes in Peninsular Malaysia under different management systems (large plantation estates versus smallholdings) and age classes (uniform age versus mixed-age stands). We sampled 41 large plantation estates and 14 smallholdings, as well as 20 sites in an extensively logged peat swamp forest, the type of natural forest prior to conversion to oil palms. Compared with logged peat swamp forest, our results showed that forest conversion to oil palm cultivation may have eliminated 48-60% of bird species. We also found: (i) plantation estates and smallholdings supported similar bird assemblages but the latter supported significantly more species (P = 0.007); and (ii) despite reduced species richness in oil palm landscapes, we found high abundance of some individual bird species in specific types of stands including some forest, migratory, and wetland species. Conversion of natural forest to oil palm landscapes should not occur in the future through clearing of primary or secondary native forests. To complement conventional conservation approaches (e.g. the establishment of protected areas) in palm oil-producing countries, existing plantation estates and smallholdings should be managed in ways to promote improved conservation outcomes, although oil palm landscapes maintained a fraction of the original forest biodiversity. Managing habitat heterogeneity at both a local and a landscape-level is highly recommended in oil palm landscapes to maintain and/or enhance avian biodiversity. ### Countries mentioned: Malaysia ### Topics keywords: palm oil;developing country;oil palm;specie richness;protected area;large scale;RO;oil palm plantation;NF ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2011,,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2011.08.026,,#36273,,"",""
"The continuity of a village industry in a Philippine community: The pottery of Bari, Antique Provice","","Abstract: This research note aims to explore the existence of a traditional village industry in a Philippine community. The village of Bari is known for its pottery within the Province of Antique. It has been producing traditional wares such as water jars, cooking stoves and plant pots for local consumption. The first attempt to develop the pottery of Bari with a new kiln took place in the 1950s. With the Philippine government's policy to promote ceramic industries for export since the 1980's the Department of Trade and Industry planned and implemented several projects such as forming an association of potters, providing loans and introduction new technology. Despite these efforts, the pottery of Bari has shown no sign of expansion or growth. It has maintained its traditional structure up to the present. In Bari, pottery has been manufactured by the wives of small farmers and agricultural workers who live at the subsistence level. The need to secure a rice supply as well as cash income determines the division of labor in the household: the husband farms rice and the wife makes pottery. Their primary goal in making pottery is to meet the basic needs of the household and provide education for their children. Development projects, which endeavored only to improve the manufacturing process, were not appropriate to this socioeconomic situation of the potters. They have not only persisted in their traditional way, however, but also responded as independent artisans to trends in the local market. For instance, products such as charcoal cooking stoves which carry the name of a brand of propane gas, and a new type of plant pot called b unsay indicate the sign of change. It appears that such innovations have been able to sustain this village industry. ### Countries mentioned: Italy;Philippines;Somalia ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: development project ### Topics keywords: contract farming;rural household;factor influencing ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2000,,Southeast Asian Studies,,,,,,,#36861,,"",""
The contribution of biological nitrogen fixation for sustainable agricultural systems 1n the tropics,"","Abstract: The pressing need to increase food production in the tropics to feed the burgeoning population of the Third World requires that crop yields ha-1 must be increased without prejudicing the resource base for future generations. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), especially that associated with legumes, has great potential to contribute to productive and sustainable agricultural systems for the tropics, but more research is required to investigate how biologically fixed N, and the increased BNF contributions resulting from research innovations, can be incorporated into viable agricultural systems to increase crop or pasture yields and to substitute N fertiliser inputs. A majority of the soils of the humid and semi-humid tropics have mineral fractions composed of 1:1 lattice clays or sesquioxides of relatively low capacity to retain nutrients (CEC) and water (WHC). It is the soil organic matter (SOM) which has high CEC (after liming) and WHC, and soils under undisturbed climax vegetation are usually high in organic matter which is responsible for their fertility. The key to the long term fertility of such soils is to maintain their soil organic matter by the preservation of crop residues and the selection of suitable crop rotations or fallows. In this review we examine several types of agricultural systems utilised in the tropics ranging from pastures, ley cropping, zero-till rotations as well as green manuring and discuss the management options that can be adopted to preserve their agricultural productivity through the strategic use of legumes in these systems, and their effects on pasture and crop yields. The introduction of forage legumes into tropical pastures can increase and sustain their productivity, with only modest inputs of lime and P and K fertilisers. Similarly, crop and pasture rotations (ley cropping) maintain SOM and soil fertility and crop yields can benefit greatly from the introduction of pasture legumes into the ley. Continuous cropping under minimum or zero tillage can maintain soil cover, and stimulate the retention of SOM, such that nutrient losses are often minimal, and legume derived N can be efficiently transferred to subsequent crops. The options for the resource-poor small-holder to efficiently utilise biologically fixed N as a N supply for cereal grains are more limited and need more attention from researchers as well as less neglect from government organisations. The addition of lime and P fertiliser in modest quantities in many under-developed regions could make large contributions to increased crop yields. If such modest fertiliser inputs were to be combined with suitable crop rotations including green manure or grain legume crops, larger increases in crops yields could be achieved on a sustainable basis, but in many regions agricultural extension services are non-existent and poor farmers have little access to even these basic chemical inputs. ### Plant products search: cereal grain;cereals;grain;grain legumes;citrus fruits ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;organic farming;natural resource;CEC;cropping system;CA;soil fertility;zero tillage;green manure;NH4 N;NH4;NO3;GM;NT;long term;paddy field;crop rotation;DM;cation exchange capacity;non GM;TP;organic matter;SOM;organic fertilizer;ZT;cover crop;sustainable development;future generation;OM;crop residue;extension service;grain legume;sustainable agriculture",1997,,Soil Biology and Biochemistry,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0038-0717(96)00221-0,,#37018,,"",""
The Control of Sleeping Sickness in Northern Nigeria.,"","Abstract: The Anchau Settlement in the Zaria and Kano Provinces of Northern Nigeria has previously been mentioned in this , but the account given by the present author is the first seen by the reviewer in which the administrative details have been fully described. The settlement was conceived as part of the scheme for the control of trypanosomiasis, in view of the fact that control by mass treatment, although highly successful, could not be regarded as a final answer to the problem, in that it seemed impossible by that method alone completely to eradicate the human disease; moreover, mass treatment was not applied to cattle. The area of the Settlement was chosen because it seemed probable that complete eradication of tsetse could be achieved and maintained by an effort not beyond the capacity of the population; the corridor which will eventually be rendered free from fly is about 70 miles in length and comprises 700 square miles. In this corridor the people from surrounding (and infested) districts are, or will be, concentrated; they will be protected from fly, but the fact of concentration and removal to strange surroundings must inevitably introduce new problems, medical, veterinary, agricultural and social. All these problems must be solved; many were anticipated and provided for, but others could not be foreseen. . ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;chemical composition;risk assessment ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1945,,Farm and Forest,,,,,,,#36193,,"",""
The cost structure of the Kenya coffee industry.,"","Abstract: As Kenya's major export crop, coffee is an important source of income necessary for planned economic development and growth of industry. The International Coffee Agreement has limited Kenya's exports to its traditional markets, and the output must be cut. In isolating the higher cost producers, the study shows how estates and small holdings constitute the two historically separate sectors of production. The costing determinants are examined with the help of two extensive sample surveys, and a cost output relationship. It is concluded that as the size of the production unit increases in both sectors, average costs decrease; many producers in both sectors of production are already operating at a loss. It is recommended that (i) a loans and insurance system be introduced to existing institutions, to induce some of the smaller scale producers in each sector to change to another crop; (ii) only the best coffee be sold on the export market by the lowest cost producers for the highest prices; and (iii) domestic consumption be encouraged to absorb the remaining coffee.

"The cow, the Peul and the manager.","","Abstract: The background to the international milk market, and the effects of imports by developing countries of surpluses from the developed world, either as food aid or as subsidized imports are reviewed. Investment in powdered milk processing factories, often by international aid programmes, means that use of imported powdered milk is generally cheaper than locally-produced milk, which is hindered by low yields and transport difficulties. However this is contributing to the destruction of dairy farming in certain countries, particularly by nomads in the Sahel region, among whom it is traditional and the only means of making a living from the arid land. A case study is made of the Peul nomads in Senegal, where powdered milk imports are high. Nestlé has had a factory in Senegal since 1961, and since 1990 has been trying to substitute locally-produced milk for imported milk for its products. However, the main problem has been in supply, and in the low prices paid to producers, which correspond to the low import prices. ### Countries mentioned: Senegal ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: food aid program;international aid program ### Topics keywords: dairy farming;dairy industry;developing country ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1994,,Économie et Humanisme,,,,,,,#37542,,"",""
"The decline of Lahawin pastoralism (Kassala Province, Eastern Sudan).","","Abstract: The paper discusses the Lahawin, one of the main pastoralist groups in the Sudan, whose dry-season camps lie on the river Atbara upstream of the New Halfa scheme, as an important example of the direct encroachment on pastoralist resources by extensive mechanized rainfed farming. It describes the threat to them of mechanized farming and other factors. The migratory patterns of Lahawin pastoralists, their own agricultural activity and the effects upon them of large-scale mechanized farming and the recent drought, all vary between different groups and are portrayed by case studies from three different areas. The encroachment on pastoralist grazing lands due to the expansion of mechanized farming has resulted in the forced settlement of Lahawin pastoralists in areas where the resources for subsistence agriculture do not exist, and in insecurity for those Lahawin who remain pastoralists. The most serious consequence of pastoralist dispossession in the area is the reduction of pastoralists into impoverished rural wage-labourers. The main cause of this long-term tendency is shown to be the drought, but extension of alluvial peasant cultivation and insecurity on the Sudan-Ethiopian border are also contributing causes. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan;Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;large scale;human activity;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1988,,"Paper, Pastoral Development Network, Overseas Development Institute, UK",,,,,,,#36480,,"",""

"The determinants of cereal crop productivity of the peasant farm sector in Ethiopia, 1981-1987.","","Abstract: This paper employs a Cobb-Douglas type production function to estimate the impacts of various farm inputs on cereal crop production in the peasant farm sector in Ethiopia. The same production function is estimated for each of the major food crops (teff, wheat, maize, barley and sorghum). On average, about 90% of crop output is explained by the two major traditional inputs, land and labour. Less than 10% of output is explained by chemical fertilizers. The impact of chemical fertilizers is small but very significant. Rainfall has an important impact on cereal production. Stagnant and declining food production is due to poor factor productivity which is mainly explained by population pressure, poor farming practice and vulnerability to droughts. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: barley;wheat;sorghum grain;maize;teff ### Measurements for interventions: fertilizer;chemical fertilizer ### Topics keywords: organic farming;chemical fertilizer;DM;land degradation;CF;farming practice;contract farming;farming system;sustainable agriculture;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1993,,"Discussion Paper - Department of Economics, University of Portsmouth",,,,,,,#37123,,"",""
The development of almond orchards in Iran,"","Abstract: Iran is in Asia, in the Middle East, with a surface area of 1,648,195 km2. Out of a total of 28 provinces, the almond is grown in 25 provinces, with 89,100 ha of adult yielding trees and 33,382 ha of young trees, at a 28-39° latitude, and 400-2500 m above sea level. Although Iran was the second exporter around 1920, in the last fifty years production has been practically steady and low. The most important limiting factors are: 1- Almond is traditionally propagated by seeds. 2- Poor farming and management. 3- Low precipitation in non-irrigated areas. 4- Most lands are marginally suitable for almond. 5- Low temperature in March and April, which causes flower damage. 6- Prevalence of highly damaging pests and diseases in some areas. The objective of the third 5-year development scheme, ending in 2004, is to add 36,000 ha of irrigated and 30,400 ha of non-irrigated orchards. Indeed, 20,000 ha of the old orchards have been recreated and replanted. The ultimate goal is to reach a general total of 160,000 tons in 2004. ### Countries mentioned: Iran ### Plant products search: almonds ### Measurements for interventions: orchard ### Topics keywords: soil fertility;DOC;drought stress ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2002,,Acta Horticulturae,,,,,,,#37411,,"",""
"The economic potential of payments for ecosystem services in water conservation: a case study in the upper reaches of Shiyang River basin, northwest China.","","Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an investigation to assess the economic potential of payments for ecosystem services to conserve water through the conversion of land under irrigation into rain-fed land in the upper reaches of the Shiyang River basin, located in northwest China. We use an approach developed by Antle and Valdivia (2006, , 50: 1-15) to estimate the supply of water. The analysis shows that it is theoretically possible to reduce agricultural water consumption and subsequently increase the water supply, which would aid the prevention of environmental degradation in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River basin. In addition to the conservation of water, considerable income would be generated by local farmers, which would help to alleviate poverty. Furthermore, the analysis also suggests that more complete data on ecosystem services rates, transaction costs and other related factors would be of value for achieving a more comprehensive assessment. ### Countries mentioned: Chile;China;Australia ### Topics keywords: contract farming;supply chain;ecosystem service;transaction cost ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2012,,Environment and Development Economics,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X12000149,,#37605,,"",""
The effect of drought and economic decline on rural women in Western Sudan,"","Abstract: This paper illustrates how long-term economic instability has combined with drought to make women in a small village in western Sudan more vulnerable to impoverishment. Increased drought and government insolvency and indifference have forced poor farmers to rely on local resources and coping strategies. A case study from Bireka village demonstrates differences in strategies between women and men, and among women of different ethnicities and social status. This paper describes how inequalities in agricultural production reflect social and economic constraints. These differences make it more difficult for women to accumulate assets and savings that are the primary insurance against a poor agricultural season. Women, however, have other options for income generation, but these too are severely affected by drought and economic decline. These crises have combined to change the nature of gender relations. While certainly rural populations, and especially women and children, are more vulnerable to future risks, the changing gender relations may be forming the foundation of new coping strategies in the face of ecological crisis. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;food insecurity;rural woman;coping strategy;rural community;decision making;extension service;dairy farming;rural area;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1993,,Geoforum,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7185(93)90017-C,,#37516,,"",""
The effect of drought risk perception on local people coping decisions in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia.,"","Abstract: In an attempt to address the objectives of examining factors influencing smallholders' drought risk perception and coping to climate variability and change, this study utilized household level data collected from 384 households and employed Heckman selection model for its analysis. The study revealed that perceiving climate variability and change does not always guarantee coping and adaptation responses, particularly among the rural people who face more binding constraints that deter adaptation decisions. While educated farmers and those with strong social network are more likely to perceive climate variability and change, it is farmers with better access to weather forecast and extension services who are more likely to respond to the perceived change. Strategies targeted at enhancing smallholder adaptive capacity to the impacts of current and predicted climate change need to focus not only on creating awareness but also on improving enabling conditions through provision of tailored weather forecast and extension services as well as strengthening social network and rural infrastructure. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: social capital;food insecurity;climate change;cover crop;natural resource;local people;growing season;social network;protected area;factor influencing;extension service;climate variability;medicinal plant;human activity;CC;long term;adaptive capacity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2015,,Journal of Development and Agricultural Economics,,,,,,,#36629,,"",""
The effect of Rhizobium seed inoculation on yields and quality of forage and seed of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and its impact on soil fertility and smallholder farmer's income.,"","Abstract: A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of Rhizobium seed inoculation on forage and seed yield components and the forage quality of berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum). The experiment comprised of two treatments, seed inoculation with Rhizobium trifolii and the non-inoculation (control). The results revealed that the seed inoculation significantly affected (P<0.005) and produced maximum number of stems/m2 (348.2), plant height (24.4 cm), green forage yield (39.9 t/ha), dry matter yield (5.54 t/ha), number of heads per m2 (339), number of seeds per head (24.5), 1000-seed weight (3.851 g) and predicted seed yield (320 kg/ha) as compared to non-inoculated plots. The similar trend of results was also found in the forage quality parameters and seed inoculation produced maximum values of neutral detergent fiber (26.5%), crude protein (28.6%) and water soluble carbohydrates (2.02%). However, the acid detergent fiber (21.0%) and metabolisable energy (10.7%) were found to be non-significant. The use of Rhizobium inoculum also added available nitrogen (N) to soil after the crop increasing available N to 0.0414% as compared to 0.0283% in the non-inoculated control. The use of Rhizobium trifolii inoculum in combination with the improved variety Agaitti Berseem-2002, produced an additional net income of PKR 111,913 Rs/ha (US$ 1145/ha) compared to noninoculated plots. ### Plant products search: cloves;clover ### Measurements for interventions: seed inoculation;inoculated control;inoculation ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;experiment conducted;cropping system;soil fertility;dry matter;ADF;NDF;net income;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;NH4;field experiment;NO3;flow rate;DM;significant difference;economic benefit;field experiment conducted;seed weight;CP;plant height;crude protein;growing season;FYM;smallholder farmer;DAS;grain yield",2018,,"JAPS, Journal of Animal and Plant Sciences",,,,,,,#36718,,"",""

NERICA: a hope for fighting hunger and poverty in Africa.,"","Abstract: NERICA (new rice for Africa), a new promising African upland rice species, is getting into the limelight in West-Africa, it has been developed through crossing African rice species (known for resistant to disease and drought) and Asian rice species (for its high yield potential) with the assistance from Japan, UNDP and other organizations. Its varieties are being hailed as a ""miracle crop"" that can bring Africa its long-promised green revolution in rice that is why a powerful coalition of governments, research institutes, private seed companies and donors are leading a major effort to spread NERICA seeds to all the continent's rice fields. At first, the NERICA researchers insisted that they did not intend NERICA to replace local diversity. Indeed, the incorporation of new seeds is nothing new for African farmers because as usual, new varieties are often mixed with old ones and become part of the selection process, contributing to the local genetic heritage, and now it is perfectly adapted to the harsh growing environment and low-input conditions of upland rice ecologies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where smallholder farmers lack the means to irrigate and apply chemical fertilizers or pesticides and it responds even better to higher inputs. This promising new rice for Africa combine high yield, short duration, resistance to pest and diseases, more protein and amino-acid content, iron and zinc, and an acceptable taste, and since its creation so far, the New Rice for Africa (NERICA) has carved a special niche for itself among upland rice farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): today, it is a symbol of hope for food security in the SSA and as the Africa rice center declares with pride on its web pages, the New Rice for Africa, a technology from Africa for Africa, has become a symbol of hope for food security in a region of the world where one-third of the people are undernourished and half the population struggle to survive on US $1 a day or less; also the Africa rice center director-general Papa Abdoulaye Seck comments, ""NERICA is a powerful weapon on Africa's fight against hunger and poverty"". ### Countries mentioned: Japan ### Plant products search: pawpaw;rice ### Programs found: united nation development program (UNDP) ### Topics keywords: green revolution;chemical composition;amino acid;chemical fertilizer;DM;SSA;CF;contract farming;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Molecular Plant Breeding,,,,,,,#37433,,"",""
No one can kill the drought: understanding complexity in the relationship between drought and conflict amongst pastoralists in northern kenya,"","Abstract: Climate-induced resource scarcity is currently cited as one of the most important drivers of human conflict, particularly in the developing world. It is predicted that in the coming years, rising global temperatures may increase aridity in a number of resource-poor regions, precipitating violence, as subsistence populations struggle to maintain livelihoods. East African pastoral communities have long adapted to unpredictable, adverse climatic conditions by modifying behaviours according to their environmental circumstance. A growing concern, however, is whether pastoralists can adapt to prolonged periods of drought, reduced rangeland productivity, and increased livelihood insecurity. A number of studies have argued that pastoralists may rely on violent livestock raids in order to recoup herd losses incurred during drought periods. This thesis investigates the apparent relationship between drought-induced resource scarcity and inter-ethnic conflict amongst three pastoral populations in northern Kenya. Through the analysis of ethnographic data and quantitative applications, this study examines the nature of the relationship between periods of increased drought and escalations in conflict episodes, testing if there is, indeed, a direct relationship between these two phenomena. Furthermore, it builds on the complexity of this relationship by identifying a number of intermediary causal and social effects that may interact and influence the nature of the resource scarcity – conflict relationship. Game theory and socio-ecological resilience models are used as explanatory frameworks, as a way of making sense of these ‘chaotic’ interactions. Ultimately, this thesis presents new theoretical perspectives in understanding resource-based conflicts, tests the adaptive ‘limits’ of subsistence populations, and examines the impact that conflict has on the resilience of pastoral communities. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Topics keywords: developing country;winter wheat;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;developing world;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548708584?accountid=9902,,#36417,,"",""
Nutrient Usage in Punjab Agriculture--Status and Constraints,"","Abstract: Many natural resources, which were once regarded as free goods, have now become scarce resources. Economic development affects the environment more often in a negative way, same is true for land use in Punjab agriculture. The profitable combination of rice-wheat crops has led to higher doses of inputs like chemical fertilizers and pesticides. But, the trend undertaken to sustain productivity in an imbalanced way has affected the soil health adversely. Excessive use has created deficiencies of nutrients in the soil leading to higher fertilization, increased costs and squeezing profit margins. Consumption of chemical fertilizers was found to be almost double of Indian consumption in 2012-13. Nutrient cost in Punjab was found to be about 18 per cent of the total operational cost in wheat crop, followed by 12.5 per cent in paddy and nearly eight per cent in case of cotton crop respectively. Sampled farmers in sub-mountainous zone (zone I) were found to be using fertilizer sprays according to recommendation, followed by zone III and lastly by zone II. Zone II is the central plain zone or wheat paddy zone, where farmers were not using fertilizers as per the package of practices. If we see category-wise, small farmers were using fertilizers more optimally than medium and large farmers in the state. The expenditure on fertilizer use was higher than that calculated at recommended level of fertilize use. The prominent reason to use higher levels of fertilizer than recommended was cited as to enhance the yields of crops, followed by maintenance of soil fertility and to cope with deficit rains/water availability. Only 2 per cent of the farmers showed ignorance about proper knowledge regarding fertilizer doses but they highlighted the constraints regarding the issue and the associated environmental problems to be solved. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: cotton;rice;wheat ### Measurements for interventions: operational cost ### Topics keywords: natural resource;chemical fertilizer;DM;soil fertility;land use;CF;contract farming ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2016,,Indian Journal of Economics and Development,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1602892&site=ehost-live,,#36331,,"",""
Oil palm in Cameroon.,"","Abstract: The oil palm is indigenous in Cameroon and palm oil is produced from semiwild oil palms and from improved planted palms on estates and smallholdings. The oil palm became a major estate crop after 1960 and Cameroon is fourth largest producer in Africa with 7% of production. On a world scale, Cameroon is one of the medium-sized producers after Malaysia, Indonesia and Nigeria. Two state corporations, CDC and Socapalm, are the main producers, with about 70% of the total area of 53 000 ha under improved oil palm. Several private estates account for 26% of the area and the remaining 4% is planted by individual smallholders. An estimated 30% of the total production of palm oil is from semi-wild oil palms harvested by farmers; fruits are processed with hand-extraction methods or with medium-technology installations. Ecological conditions are moderately suitable in the oil palm area along the coast. The rainfall distribution data show a distinct dry period from December to February/March and this limits production to 1.5-2.5 t of palm oil per ha. Production costs of crude palm oil and kernels were about equal to the prices determined by the government (1982) but these prices were well above corresponding prices on the world market in 1982 and in previous years. The processing industry is small and only kernels are produced into end-products as refined kernel oil, soap and detergents. A palm oil refinery is under construction. The need for a refining industry is limited as most of the crude palm oil is sold to domestic consumers who are accustomed to use the crude palm oil directly. Non-factor inputs such as fertilizers, vehicles and processing equipment are imported. The government plays a major role in the oil palm sector as main producer, through determination of the prices for palm oil and kernels, and through control of exports. The government plans to expand the oil palm area on smallholdings around existing estates. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Cameroon;Malaysia;Indonesia ### Plant products search: fruits ### Topics keywords: palm oil;oil palm;supply chain;processing industry;raw material ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1987,,The economics of oil palm.,,,,,,,#37115,,"",Unclear

Padi farming in West Malaysia.,"","Abstract: With one million acres under the crop, padi comes next in importance to rubber in the land use pattern of West Malaysia. About 20 per cent. of the economically active population is in the padi growing sector. Padi cultivation is confined to smallholdings averaging three to five acres. In the last decade there has been hardly any increase in the total physical area of land under the crop, mainly because water supply and suitable flat lands are limiting factors. There are no plans to open up any large new padi areas in West Malaysia but more of the existing padi lands will be cultivated with two crops. In 1970, about a third of the padi lands were growing two crops per year but by the end of the second Malaysia Plan period in 1975, about two-thirds of the area will be harvesting two crops annually. A main objective of West Malaysian rice policy is to increase the income of padi farmers through more intensive cultivation, particularly by the growing of two padi crops per year. ### Countries mentioned: Malaysia ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: last decade;land use;point view;large scale;human activity ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1972,,"Bulletin, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries",,,,,,,#37472,,"",""
Parametrization of a dielectric mixture model to retrieve soil moisture at field scale using Sentinel-1 data and in situ soil moisture measurements,"","Abstract: In the framework of the H2020 APOLLO project a significant focus has been put on the use of high resolution satellite based products to serve small farmers in their agricultural practices. This paper presents first results achieved by using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input to a semi-empirical soil moisture (SM) retrieval model based on an algorithm originally developed for ERS SAR data and successively modified to handle ENVISAT ASAR acquisitions. In this work the model has been adapted to Sentinel-1 images and calibrated by using ground measurements taken in two test sites characterized by bare soil and cotton cultivation, aiming at testing its capability to represent the SM behavior at different stages of the vegetation cycle. The model performance has been assessed through the correlation R and root mean squared error (RMSE) between in situ and satellite retrieved SM data. Very good results have been achieved for bare soil (R&gt;0.8, RMSE&lt;0.04 m 3 m -3 ); however, the model performed worse in the cotton fields (R&lt;0.6, RMSE&gt;0.08 m 3 m -3 ). ### Plant products search: cotton ### Programs found: framework H2020 APOLLO project ### Topics keywords: EC;winter wheat;soil moisture retrieval;soil moisture;NDVI;SM;summer maize;secondary metabolite;medicinal plant;FAO;sodium adsorption ratio;root mean square;RMSE",2018,,International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS),,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518333,,#37453,,"",""
Participatory development of weed management strategies in maize based cropping systems in Kenya,"","Abstract: Participatory on farm trials undertaken in Central and Eastern Kenya compared herbicide weed control with farmers weed management practices. In Embu, Eastern Kenya, results of the short rains trials in 1999 indicated higher net benefits from chemical weeding in both sole crop maize and maize-bean intercrops. An increase of 61% in net benefits was realised by using herbicides coupled with minimum hand weeding in a maize-bean intercrop. In sole crop maize, an increase of 46% in net benefit was realised from herbicide use alone in comparison to hand weeding. Similar trends were observed in Kiambu, Central Kenya, during the long rains (April to September 2000). There was an increase of 47% net benefit from herbicide use over hand weeding in sole crop maize crop. The maize yields from herbicide treated plots were 31% higher than those from hand weeded plots while the total cost of weeding was significantly reduced by 43%. The potential for wider application of herbicide technology in smallholder maize production systems is therefore enormous, albeit relatively unexploited in Eastern Africa. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: maize;grain legumes ### Topics keywords: cropping system;weed control;hand weeding;weed management practice;DAS;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2001,,"BCPC CONFERENCE - WEEDS 2001, VOLS 1 AND 2",,,,,,,#36717,,"",""
Participatory rural development in Bangladesh: an overview.,"","Abstract: The paper examines participatory rural development in Bangladesh and considers structural constraints and paradoxes embedded in participatory rural development strategies. After a brief introduction, the second section presents a profile of the socioeconomic environment of the elitist rural society, considering demography, agricultural labour force, rural income, health, literacy, amenities, housing, water and infrastructure. The third section: considers the strands of thinking that go into participatory rural development and examples from other countries: and focuses on the 'Comilla Model', which became institutionalized in the Bangladesh Rural Development Board and consisted of four components: two structured cooperatives; the Thana Training and Development Centre; the Thana Irrigation Programme; Rural Works Programme. However, Comilla's inherent weaknesses lie in neglect of disadvantaged groups: rural poor; landless farmers; women. Thus three area development projects have been undertaken by government with donor aid. The fourth section comments on some paradoxes in participatory rural development. The penultimate section, whilst acknowledging the desirability of NGOs, pinpoints their inherent contradictions. It concludes, nevertheless, that the role of NGOs is increasingly called for; they fill a gap left by government and their performance is quite impressive compared to public extension. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh ### Programs found: work program;irrigation program;rural work program;rural development (RD) project;development project;program rural (PROW);rural development project (RDP) ### Topics keywords: contract farming;rural community;NGO;rural development ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1998,,Asian Profile,,,,,,,#36719,,"",Observational; interventions
The effects of climate change on Paleoindian demography,"","Abstract: This study examines site frequencies and faunal data from Pleistocene, Younger Dryas, and Early Holocene age sites from New Mexico and Wyoming to investigate the effects of climate change on human demography and subsistence. Paleoclimatic data and ecological models are linked to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the connections between temperature, primary productivity, and ultimately human demographic and subsistence trends. It is shown that the Younger Dryas stadial negatively impacted Paleoindian populations in Wyoming and positively impacted those in New Mexico. The following Early Holocene period had the opposite effects. While the study area limits tests of changes in subsistence, bison are shown to be more common than expected in Younger Dryas faunal assemblages and lagomorphs are more common than expected in Early Holocene faunal assemblages. This indicates decreasing foraging efficiency through time. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Mexico ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;cover crop;climate change;CC ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2008,,,,,,,http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/287964557?accountid=9783,,#36773,,"",""
The environment and ecology of pastoralists in arid savannas.,"","Abstract: The paper concentrates on the dynamic interactions of pastoralists and their environment. For the purpose of looking at human ecology in arid savannas, three interrelated environmental components are delineated and discussed: the physical (or abiotic), the biotic, and the population. Attention is then turned to efficiency and pastoral systems are compared with other systems. Key features in pastoral efficiency are indicated: mobility, species diversity, stocking rates, livestock breeds, human efficiency. Succeeding sections discuss stability, and pastoralism and technology. It is concluded that, while most agronomists would claim that definite improvements can be made in the productivity of extreme pastoral environments, a complete switch to low-labour, modern beef marketing by pastoralists is unlikely in the near future for a number of reasons, social, economic and ecological. ### Animal products search: beef ### Topics keywords: DM;stocking rate;dairy farm;beef cattle",1982,,Development and Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7660.1982.tb00117.x,,#37114,,"",""

The factors hindering development.,"","Abstract: The agriculture sector is subject to various hazards and risk factors so that climatic and environmental factors affect it and often limit what can be cultivated. Some of these can be overcome, but differing costs and benefits are incurred and the prospects for Italian agriculture must be assessed bearing in mind these factors. The most important are: firstly, the proportion of agricultural land situated on plains, hilly or mountainous areas. Secondly, the type of soils in a given area. Other problems are of the structural/legal typology such as a rigid and flawed land tenure system and the fragmentation of single holdings. In many cases intensification and large injections of capital are needed to overcome some of the obstacles and, where this is not viable, extensive cultivation is pursued. Italy has a greater percentage of mountainous and depressed areas than other EU countries. The EU has recognised this by aiding farmers to earn supplementary income through other environmentally-friendly rural activities in conjunction with extensive farming, thus stemming the rural exodus. Regarding the South , water supply is the greatest constraint, together with the persistent problem of small farm size: the gap between Italy and other EU countries is widening in this respect and this represents one of Italian agriculture's fundamental problems. ### Countries mentioned: Italy ### Topics keywords: land reform;land degradation;EU;farm size;land tenure;EU country ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1996,,Agricoltura,,,,,,,#36169,,"",""
"(The development of the socioeconomic position of settlers in the virgin forest in Paraguay, agrarian reform).

Settlers' difficulties included poor health and completely unsatisfactory medical care, inadequate water supply, title to land not legally confirmed, arbitrary actions by administrative authorities, permanent indebtedness, and exploitive marketing systems. However, there was an improvement in formal schooling, incomes were raised and settlers are supplied with simple farm equipment and tools and with animals. To improve the situation supporting agencies should 1) try to raise the level of consciousness of the settlers, 2) bring in adequate extension and advisory services, and 3) support and encourage the settlers' efforts at self help.-from WAERSA ### Countries mentioned: Germany;Paraguay ### Topics keywords: land reform;agrarian reform;extension service;family farming;advisory service ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1979,,Zeitschrift fur Auslandische Landwirtschaft,,,,,,,#36380,,"",""
The dynamics of natural montane forests in Madagascar.,"","Abstract: Natural humid montane forests still cover significant areas in eastern Madagascar. Although their productivity is low, they have important ecological functions. Demographic pressure, agrarian practices, rain-fed or irrigated rice crops, cash crops and cyclones have combined to produce profound transformations in forest landscapes. The natural forests of eastern Madagascar have long been threatened by two different factors: in the eastern part, forest dynamics are conditioned by cash cropping and market trends, while to the west, natural forests have been almost entirely lost to irrigated rice crops. Landscape patterns have subsequently been modified by eucalyptus plantations in small-holdings. In some cases, there is a correlation between the dynamics produced by these two factors, which are influenced by economic links between the communities living on either side of the montane forest, i.e. markets for cash crops and access strategies to forest lands both determine changes in forest landscapes. Implementing a new forest policy based on transferring responsibility for local forest management to grassroots level could help to preserve these natural montane forests if local populations are allowed to use them for their own benefit. ### Countries mentioned: Madagascar ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: cover crop;rural household;cash crop;RO;sweet potato;farming system;NF ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2003,,Bois et Forêts des Tropiques,,,,,,,#36940,,"",""
The ecological effects of young elm trees belt-pumpkin strip intercropping system at the agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China.,"","Abstract: Young elm trees belt-pumpkin strip intercropping was studied to solve the actual problem of resource losses in the large barren area resulted from reconverting cultivated land into forest in the agro-pastoral ecotone in northern China. The final objective was to realize effective utilization of the barren land with both ecological improvement and economic development. Field experiments were conducted together with laboratory analysis. The results indicated that the soil moisture level was remarkably increased in young elm trees belt-pumpkin strip intercropping because the pumpkin vines covered the gap between pumpkin planting-furrow and elm trees belt. The water use efficiency of the intercropping system was increased by 23.7-163.3% as compared with the single cropping. Elm trees belt-pumpkin strip intercropping changed the sequential succession trend of the grasses growing in the gap of the pumpkin planting-furrow. The annual grasses become the dominant vegetation. The nutritive value as fodder and yield of the annual grasses were also increased remarkably. The biomass of pumpkin, elm trees and grasses under intercropping increased by 24.4, 28.4 and 144.4%, respectively, as compared with those under single cropping. The land use efficiency was increased by 132%. It was also indicated that the soil erosion from the intercropping land was not increased due to pumpkin plantation. The differences in the soil erosion among intercropped area, elm trees belt and pumpkin strip with single cropping were not remarkable. Therefore, it was concluded that young elm trees belt-pumpkin strip intercropping is an effective way to utilize the barren land between the young elm trees belt and realize synergistic enhancement of ecological benefit and economic profit. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Plant products search: squashes ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;soil erosion;experiment conducted;cropping system;SM;use efficiency;dry matter;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;field experiment;flow rate;DM;WUE;significant difference;cultivated land;field experiment conducted;plant height;intercropping system;land use;growing season;soil moisture;nutritive value;FYM;DAS;grain yield ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2010,,Agricultural Sciences in China,,,,,,,#37243,,"",""
"The ecology of malnutrition in seven countries of Southern Africa and in Portuguese Guinea. The Republic of South Africa, South West Africa (Namibia), Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Mozambique, Angola, Portuguese Guinea.","","Abstract: All these problems have both economic and political facets which are common to all the countries discussed. The economic facet is centered around food production and distribution. Leaving aside the ruling European minority of South Africa, food production in all the countries is based largely on the traditional pattern of communal land tenure, shifting agriculture, subsistence crops and unproductive pastoral activities. There are some promising exceptions: in Angola and Mozambique, over 30 per cent. of the African-grown crop is commercialized and contributes to the money income of the provinces, but in most places the food supply is inadequate, poorly distributed, and insufficient to insure the kind of nutrition needed for health and hard work. By and large, solutions remain better balanced between the areas sown in food crops and industrial crops, development of irrigation, increase in fertilization, etc. These recommendations remain valid, even though the so-called "" miracle seeds "" of rice, corn and wheat have been developed. Little evaluation has been published as yet on the possible impact of these high-yielding seeds on African agricultural production. Rice and maize are the dietary staples of the populations discussed in this volume and wheat is being grown to some extent in all countries; hence, theoretically it would be possible to triple their food incomes. However, warnings are being given on the dangers of indiscriminate promotion of these new lines of grain. Before the benefits of the "" Green Revolution "" are placed at the disposal of Africa, a great deal of careful planning is needed. The danger seems to be real that the considerable investment required to raise the triple crops promised might bring a no less sizeable return in social upheaval, increased pollution, economic chaos and uncontrollable growth of cities throughout the developing world. Dealing with the political facet of the transition problem is equally difficult. At least three different systems are being followed by the eight countries of this book, each conditioned by historical background. Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland have been British Protectorates and are trying to solve their difficulties in a legalistic way, giving much weight to the elite produced by previous generations and by African traditions. The Republic of South Africa and South West Africa are also using the elite system. In the Portuguese territories, the evolution is based on the complete assimilation of the African into the European culture, facilitating the eventual merging of two societies.

The economics of transformation toward sustainable hill country land use: Whatawhata case study.,"","Abstract: The Whatawhata integrated catchment management project generated a substantial amount of data on the biophysical impacts of land use and management change-livestock enterprise performance, terrestrial biodiversity, water quality etc. The question has been posed: What was the impact of the changes on the financial viability of the catchment farm system? Farm operating budgets before and after land use changes, enterprise gross margins, costs associated with tree planting, and farm system modelling with FarmaxPro® have been integrated to give a whole-system view of farm business viability over the long term (1995-2030). This information compared the existing system (1990s) with the new system implemented in 2000. Annual operating profit for the 296 ha breeding ewe and breeding cow system in the late 1990s was between $25 000-$30 000 reflecting the size and land use capability distribution of the block. Changes to the livestock enterprises improved farm surplus from ca. $100/ha to ca. $330/ha in the first 3 years, but on a reduced pastoral land area (150 ha). This gave an annual operating profit (EFS) of ca. $50 000. Much of this difference reflected product price movements. The cost of land use change was approximately $969 000 over the first 10 years. Selective intensification of hill lands can improve per ha profitability in the short-medium term. Two key financial issues, the transformation cost and medium term viability, need to be addressed in implementing land use change to move toward hill land sustainability. ### Programs found: integrated catchment management (ICM) project;whatawhata integrated catchment management (ICM) project;management project;land use (LULUCF) management project ### Topics keywords: small scale;short term;land use change;GM;crop rotation;LUC;land use;towards sustainable;taking account;non GM;farm size;medium term;sweet potato;gross margin;beef cattle;sustainable agriculture;long term",2014,,Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association,,,,,,,#37175,,"",""
"The effects of waterlogging on growth, photosynthesis and biomass allocation in perennial ryegrass (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Lolium perenne</i> L.) genotypes with contrasting root development.","","Abstract: Perennial ryegrass is often subject to transient waterlogging during winter under dryland conditions and summer when flood-irrigated. Despite this, little is known about the physiological responses of perennial ryegrass genotypes to waterlogging. In a pot experiment, four perennial ryegrass genotypes with contrasting root growth characteristics were subjected to waterlogging for 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 or 28 days. The masses of roots and shoots of the genotype Aurora6 were not significantly (&gt;0.05) reduced by waterlogging, throughout the experiment. All other genotypes exhibited reductions in root and shoot biomass between 14 and 21 days after waterlogging was imposed. The masses of laminae and roots of susceptible genotypes were reduced by up to 70% after 28 days of waterlogging. Aurora6 was also able to maintain photosynthesis for longer into the waterlogging period. However, after 28 days of waterlogging, photosynthesis of all genotypes was reduced by 30-50%. The waterlogging tolerance of Aurora6 was not due to its relatively poor root growth, as its progeny (2178), which also had poor root growth under control conditions, was susceptible to waterlogging. These findings show that there is variation in physiological processes and herbage yield of perennial ryegrass under waterlogged conditions. The implications of these findings for the genetic improvement of waterlogging tolerance of perennial ryegrass are discussed. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Philippines ### Measurements for interventions: photosynthesis ### Topics keywords: DM;genetic improvement;drought stress;dairy cattle ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2003,,Journal of Agricultural Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859603003502,,#36368,,"",""
The emergy of metabolism in different ecosystems under the same environmental conditions in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern China.,"","Abstract: The sustainability of ecosystem productivity and rules governing ecosystem development are important topics of scientific research. The emergy approach is an effective method for investigating these topics, especially when used to evaluate systems that have developed under the same environmental conditions, such as climate and soil. In this paper, emergy differences between terrestrial ecosystems were studied in Guyuan County, a region representative of the agro-pastoral ecotone in Hebei Province, China. A combination of field tests and a questionnaire survey were carried out between June and August 2015. The ecosystems studied included natural grassland, artificial grassland, field crops and commercial crops. These four ecosystems were further subdivided into a total of ten ecosystems. Natural grassland was divided into free-grazing and mowed ecosystems; artificial grassland consisted of oat, Chinese leymus and corn silage; field crops included naked oats, flax and wheat; and commercial crops consisted of cabbage and potatoes. The results showed that the rain input of 4.78*1014 seJ/ha/yr constituted the highest renewable natural resource emergy and that the purchased emergy inputs of the ten ecosystems ranged from 3.53 to 147.67*1014 seJ/ha/yr. Natural resource emergy input was the basic power to maintain the ecosystem, and purchased emergy input was the direct cause of the development of the ecosystems. Groundwater was the most important non-renewable purchased energy for the production of economic crops. The emergy investment ratios (EIR) for potatoes (27.81) and cabbage (19.03) were higher than those of the other ecosystems, but mowed and artificial Chinese leymus grassland had the higher emergy self-sufficiency rates (ESR). Natural grassland, artificial Chinese leymus grassland and traditional grain crops had a low environmental load and high sustainability, whereas potatoes and cabbage had a high environmental load and low sustainability. Overall, rain-fed artificial grassland has a high development potential from the perspective of environment and productivity. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Plant products search: wheat;oats;maize;potatoes;grain;leafy vegetables ### Measurements for crops: potatoes ### Measurements for interventions: purchased emergy input ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;natural resource;self sufficiency;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,Ecological Indicators,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.11.028,,#37256,,"",""

The first public-private partnership in irrigation in Morocco: sustainable for all?,"","Abstract: Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a relatively recent phenomenon in the irrigation sector; the El Guerdane project in Morocco is the first of its kind worldwide. Implemented in 2008, it now provides water to 10,000 ha of highly lucrative citrus fruit plantations. International development banks present this project as a success story, but results in terms of local development have been at best mixed. While some farmers have benefited from the initiative, others have experienced increased marginalization from water, fertile land, and development. Based on extensive field research in the El Guerdane area between 2005 and 2013, the present paper identifies three key critical issues posed by this PPP: partly negative effects on livelihoods and socioeconomic development; an unequal sharing of costs, benefits and risks between public and private partners; and uncertain environmental impact. Based on this analysis, the authors reflect on the significance of the project for the evolution of economic and political power relations in Morocco. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco ### Plant products search: citrus fruits ### Programs found: benefit initiative;irrigation sector el guerdane project;plan program (PPP);paddy pledging program (PPP);international development bank present project;significance project ### Topics keywords: short term;human health;environmental impact;point view;negative effect;factor influencing;human activity;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2016,,Cahiers Agricultures,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1051/cagri/2016009,,#36276,,"",""
The future of African hunter-gatherers and pastoral people.,"","Abstract: The papers in this collection consider what might be the future of African pastoral and hunter-gatherers' ways of life and whether their apparent decline is inevitable, or necessarily in the best interests either of the peoples themselves or of the countries in which they live. The case studies add to the body of published evidence concerning the astute economic and ecological strategies followed by African pastoralists: the critical facts emphasized are that without massive technological changes, potential carrying capacity in arid climates is largely climatically determined because of the close relationship between actual evapotranspiration and net primary production. A number of tentative conclusions are presented concerning the nature of hunter-gatherers and pastoral economies and are grouped under the headings: ecological efficiency, economic productivity, resilience, access to land and capital, relationship of social organization to land-use strategies. Present development policies are examined and attention is then turned to long-term trends and future policies. It is concluded that, both for reasons of equity and efficiency, a new policy oriented towards the development of traditional African pastoralism is urgently needed. Six important elements to such a policy are outlined: (1) control of land, (2) relationship of pastoralism to agriculture, (3) raising pastoral productivity, (4) poverty-oriented risk-avoiding strategies, (5) meeting basic social service needs, (6) participatory institutions. ### Topics keywords: land use;human activity;long term",1982,,Development and Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7660.1982.tb00116.x,,#36781,,"",""
The impact of climate change on the distribution of rural income in Ethiopia,"","Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that global climate change is likely to increase the incidence of environmental disasters, as well as the frequency of extreme weather events. As a result, it is generally recognized that climate and weather variability has negative impacts on households’ welfare relying mainly on agriculture. In Ethiopia, 95% of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture and consequently the economic impact of climate change is crucial for small-scale farmers’ food security and welfare. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of climate change on rural households’ welfare in Ethiopia by using a Quantile Regression (QR) analysis. The main econometric results show that the elasticity of crop income with respect to rainfall varies across quantiles. It is confirmed that there is a non-linear relationship between climatic variables and income. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: small scale;cover crop;climate change;CC;environmental impact;rural household;negative impact;extension service;small scale farmer;factor affecting;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2018,,International Journal of Environmental Studies,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2018.1475914,,#37369,,"",""
THE IMPACT OF MINERAL FERTILIZATION AND ATMOSPHERIC PRECIPITATION ON YIELD OF FIELD CROPS ON FAMILY FARMS,"","Abstract: The field crop production, as the most important branch of plant production of the Republic of Serbia, in the period 2002-2011, was carried out on an average of over 2.7 million hectares, 82.7% of which took place on the individual farms/family holdings. Hence, the subject of research in this paper covers yields of major field crops realized on family farms in the region of Vojvodina in the period 1972-2011. The main objective of the research is to study the interdependence of utilization of mineral fertilizers and atmospheric precipitation during the vegetation period and realized yields of major field crops on family farms in the observed period The regression analysis was applied in order to verify dependencies and determine the form of dependence of achieved yields from examined variables. The results showed that the main limiting factors for obtaining high and stable yields of field crops is inadequate use of fertilizers and the lack of precipitation during the vegetation period. ### Countries mentioned: Serbia ### Topics keywords: organic fertilizer;nitrogen fertilizer;million hectare;arable land;crop rotation;regression analysis;soil fertility;mineral fertilizer;sewage sludge;factor affecting;NPK ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2016,,EKONOMIKA POLJOPRIVREDA-ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURE,,,,,,,#36753,,"",""
The impact of resource depletion is being overshadowed by the threat of global warming,"","Abstract: The increased public and political focus on global warming has diverted discussion away from world resource depletion, particularly the depletion of fossil fuel energy with its potentially disastrous impact on world food production. According to its own internal whistleblowers, the International Energy Agency appears to have falsified information on world fossil fuel depletion-- on the grounds that telling the truth that world energy resources may already have peaked in production and are exceeded by demand, could cause skyrocketing oil prices and stampede the world into a new recession. Depletion of finite resources such as oil, gas, useable water or minerals is likely to impact on world GDP well before the worst impacts of global warming. The two together are likely to constrain world food production seriously, particularly in countries with high population densities or insufficient fertile lands. Food security in these countries is behind the huge ""land and water grab"" by foreign nationals that is now occurring across the developing world. Worldwide, governments have dealt with the recession by increasing consumption to prevent job losses which has increased demand for scarce resources, in order to return countries to growth (or business as normal). If peak oil has already arrived or is imminent, providing public funds to already damaged businesses that have large carbon footprints, is clearly irrational. Historically, global economic growth has never occurred without a simultaneous increase in the use of fossil fuel energy; GDP growth and world oil production growth have tracked each other for decades. It seems that while the IEA expects a steady increase in available oil, recent, more believable, evaluations of the decline in oil from the major giant oil fields that are already in the phase of depletion (e.g. Cantarell in Mexico and the North Sea province etc) suggests that Peak Oil arrived in 2008 and that by 2030 the production from fields currently on stream could have decreased by over 50 per cent (Hook 2009).The probable effect will be high prices flowing on into every walk of life, especially the cost of food with its huge embedded fossil fuel energy costs. This will inevitably increase financial instability and produce more recessions. Although global warming is probably the greatest problem humanity has ever faced the most immediate issue is the finite nature of fossil fuel that has supported the presently high standard of living (in industrialized countries). Without cheap oil there is no cheap food. There is no cheap water, health care, travel, housing or recreation. Without cheap energy the world contracts to using local resources and local activities. As food availability and diversity declines, it may lead to a decrease in the human population. This is contrary to the forecasted increase from 6.7 to over 8 billion people in the next 20 years. Human population increase is often considered the major problem that will impact on both resource depletion and global warming but consumerism by the wealthy is presently of major concern The carbon footprint of multi millionaires can be up to ten thousand times that of the average person in industrialised countries, which in turn is 10 times that of the average person in developing countries and many of the 1 billion subsistence farmers in the world have almost insignificant use of fossil energy. There are around 10 million people world wide with assets greater then a million dollars and therefore have disproportionate effect on world resource depletion and global warming. No politicians appear to be willing to address the problem of resource depletion and yet people are the end users and will be greatly affected as demand exceeds production for many resources, from rare earth metals through to energy and water. Politicians and business entrepreneurs appear to be willing to ignore the dangerous outlook for future generations, being only concerned with their present wealth, health and living standards and no politician wants to be the one telling their electorate that The free market economy and globalization must be severely constrained. Living standards or expectations of, in particular the rich, must be reduced-consume less, shop less, live in smaller homes, grow food locally, recreate locally and give up extravagant travel modes and also non essential travel and so on More and more people will have to cross the line from simply exercising brain power to make a living, to exercising imaginative and also efficient use of muscle power from animals and themselves to generate food. For the sake of peace and equity it will also be essential to lift the standard of living of the poor and mandate birth control in all countries if the floods of refugees that could occur through resource depletion and global warming, are to be prevented. Cuts in their use of fossil fuels should be forced first on the super rich who should pay a high price to pollute the global atmosphere at the cost of burning of fossil fuels (e.g. flying or owning private jets, large ocean cruisers, multiple cars and mansions and so on) However it is essential that everybody, above a minimum standard of living, must make some sacrifice. Few of us are going to do it voluntarily as it means giving up too much of our lifestyles for it to be effective in curbing greenhouse gases to a 'safe' level. The world needs time to adjust to even the first decade of the second half of the age of oil The objectives of governments should be to reduce fossil fuel exploitation and use it efficiently so as to maintain world reserves as high as possible to allow a slow reduction in populations and a narrowing of the resource use by rich and poor countries as society comes into equilibrium with resource availabilities. Traditional forms of economic growth will be impossible in a resource-depleted world. We need new forms of growth based upon intellect and human talent and skill rather than raw materials. Before any meaningful change of attitudes can take place, society has to understand that oil is truly finite - and is going to become very scarce sooner rather than later. Secondly the true cost of the conspicuous and wanton consumption of this fossil fuel energy must be identified and acknowledged and appropriate depletion strategies implemented. No longer should super rich people be able to excuse their extravagant life styles, by other compensatory actions such as planting trees, as their carbon emissions not only enhance global warming but will deteriorate the future standard of living of the populace in general, through resource depletion. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico ### Topics keywords: natural resource;GDP;global warming;carbon footprint;developing world;contract farming;biological control;GHG emission;developing country;chemical fertilizer;environmental impact;CF;N2O;raw material;GHG;health care;DM;LCA;population density;protected area;energy consumption;CO2;greenhouse gas;management practice;food security;biogas production;climate change;spatial distribution;sustainable development;fossil fuel;future generation;factor influencing;CH4;dairy farming;gross domestic product;human activity;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2010,,Livestock Research for Rural Development,,,,,,,#37390,,"",""
The impact of the devaluation of the CFA franc on the competitiveness of rice production in southern Benin.,"","Abstract: Benin produces 12 000 t/year of husked rice, which represents 20% of domestic consumption. Rice is not a very profitable crop for farmers because labour requirements are high (twice as much as for other crops) and prices are low. An assessment has been carried out on the impact of the 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc on the competitiveness of major crops, including rice, grown in different production systems (irrigated, flooded, rainfed). Rice yields are low regardless of the production system. Since the devaluation, rice has been more profitable for farmers and the increased income more than compensates for the inflation that followed devaluation. Cotton production has also become more profitable. Grass margins per hectare for rice production are higher than for cotton. Prior to devaluation, rice production represented a poorer return on family labour than irrigated or rainfed cotton. Following devaluation, irrigated rice represents a better return on labour than cotton, which is still more profitable for smallholders than rainfed rice. Production is also compared in the context of the national economy (imported and exported produce). ### Countries mentioned: Benin;France ### Plant products search: cotton;rice ### Measurements for crops: rice ### Topics keywords: factor influencing;agro food;farm size ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1997,,Agriculture et Développement,,,,,,,#37391,,"",""
The influence of land use change on chemical and biological properties of steppe soils in northern China.,"","Abstract: This study was conducted in an agro-pastoral transitional zone near Inner Mongolia, northern China, to assess the influence of land use conversion from native steppe to intensive agriculture and from intensive agriculture to alfalfa on soil chemical and biological properties. At two separate sites, plots representing intensive agriculture, alfalfa, and the respective native steppe type (i.e., meadow steppe and typical steppe), were established in 1980. Intensive agriculture lands were cultivated and alfalfa was sown in these intensive agriculture soils since 2002. A sensitivity index, calculated for each measured property by dividing values for the native steppes by corresponding values in intensive agriculture lands or alfalfa lands, was also used to evaluate the responses of the soil quality to land use conversion. The amount of root biomass in intensive agriculture soils was 88% at a 0-10 cm depth and 76% at a 10-20 cm depth lower than those in native steppe soils at both sites.

The integrated approach to improve sustainable livelihood in Tello Island,"","Abstract: Almost half of the population of Indonesia live in rural areas and about 14.1% are living in below rural poverty line. Improving sustainable livelihood is an essential strategy to reduce the poverty in rural areas. Some Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) work with rural communities to improve sustainable livelihood through community based-development project. Working with poor communities in rural areas is challenging because each community has specific needs and characteristics. It also needs an integrated approach to ensure effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the project. This paper provides acase study of community-based development project in a remote island (Tello Island) in South Nias, Indonesia. This island has rich natural resources but many people still live in poverty. MAP International, a NGO has worked in this island since 2011 to build the community's capacity to improve sustainable livelihood. The organization tried to support low-income people through organic farming, fishing, livestock, and microloan program. The organization started the project with water filter distribution as 'an entry point' to gain community trust. The organization also established some learning groups among beneficiaries. After five years of project implementation, some significant outcomes have been achieved such as increased income, improved skills, and education. However, there are also some challenges particularly the project sustainability. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the project. The paper also provides more details about project approach, special challenges (such as the new policy on transshipment ban that affects local fishing), and recommendation. ### Countries mentioned: Indonesia ### Programs found: sustainability project;acase study community based (CBT) development project;mesoamerican agro environmental program (MAP);market assurance program (MAP);development project;community based (CBT) development project;mexican agricultural program (MAP);microloan program;market access program (MAP);five year project (FYP) ### Topics keywords: organic farming;natural resource;rural community;rural household;rural poverty;NGO;contract farming;rural area ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2017,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PUBLIC POLICY, SOCIAL COMPUTING AND DEVELOPMENT 2017 (ICOPOSDEV 2017)",,,,,,,#37487,,"",""
The Introduction of Insect Meal into Fish Diet: The First Economic Analysis on European Sea Bass Farming,"","Abstract: The economic and environmental sustainability of aquaculture depends significantly on the nature and quality of the fish feed used. One of the main criticisms of aquaculture is the need to use significant amounts of fish meal, and other marine protein sources, in such feed. Unfortunately, the availability of the oceanic resources, typically used to produce fish feed, cannot be utilized indefinitely to cover the worldwide feed demand caused by ever-increasing aquaculture production. In light of these considerations, this study estimates how aquaculture farm economic outcomes can change by introducing insect meal into the diet of cultivated fish. Several possible economic effects are simulated, based on various scenarios, with different percentages of insect flour in the feed and varying meal prices using a case study of a specialized off-shore sea bass farm in Italy. The findings indicate that the introduction of insect mealcomposed of Tenebrio molitorwould increase feeding costs due to the high market prices of this flour and its less convenient feed conversion ratio than that of fish meal. Therefore, the expected environmental benefits of using this highly promising insect meal in fish feed do not align with the current economic interests of the aquaculture industry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate this theme, and it must be noted that our findings cannot be generalized widely because a specific case study was used. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that efforts should be madeat least at the farm level to find profitable ways to encourage the introduction of this attractive alternative to guarantee both economic and environmental sustainability in the near future. ### Countries mentioned: Italy ### Animal products search: fish meat;fish ### Topics keywords: DM;significant difference;chemical composition;feed conversion ratio ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2019,,SUSTAINABILITY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/su11061697,,#36165,,"",""

However this is limited by the mountainous terrain and marshy land, and yields are low, requiring large national imports of cereals. Agrarian structures are also responsible for inefficient production, with most of the area controlled by a few very large farms and the remainder taken up by small subsistence farms. Price policies also present little encouragement to farmers. More resources should be made available to small farmers, and in the long term extensive structural change is necessary. ### Countries mentioned: Tunisia ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: structural change;arable land;dairy industry;factor influencing;long term ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1978,,Revue Tunisienne de Geographie,,,,,,,#37552,,"",""
The Managil south-west extension: an extension to the Gezira scheme.,"","Abstract: The Gezira scheme has been enlarged by some 800, 000 feddans [1 feddan = 1.038 acres] as a result of the development known as the Managil S.-W. Extension. Part I of this paper describes the Extension and compares it with some of the features of the original irrigated area, i.e. the Gezira Main Area. Part II offers a cost/benefit analysis of the Extension, and Part III outlines some of its achievements, and some of the problems that have emerged. The Extension was developed in six stages between 1957 and 1963, its system of irrigation, pattern of field layout and method of organization and management being similar to those in the Gezira Main Area, with two important differences: (1) the crop rotation is more intensive, with a six-course vs. the eight-course rotation used in the Main Area, so that some 67 per cent. of the land is cropped in any one year as against under 50 per cent. in the Main Area; (2) the size of holding in the Extension is 15 feddans, the originally larger "" standard "" holding being reduced mainly so as to benefit more people, and also to enable a tenant and his family to work their holding without hired labour. The extension is run under the same partnership arrangement which governs the Main Area, i.e. Government, the Sudan Gezira Board and the tenant farmer each have specific functions and share the proceeds from cotton cultivation. The Extension has increased the value of the Gezira Scheme to the national economy, having more than doubled the total area under extra-long staple cotton which provides over 50 per cent. of the total value of domestic exports, and is a major source of investment for public funds, while contributing significantly to Government revenue. In 1962/63, it provided employment and food for over 41, 000 tenants and their families, and a casual labour force of 175, 000 during the cotton harvest. It has also posed new problems and accentuated old ones relating to the newly developed area, to the Gezira Scheme as a whole, and to the economic growth of the country. The Extension has embraced areas less suitable for crop production from the points of view of topography and soil, and has brought the Scheme closer to the cotton schemes on the White Nile where pest and disease control is less efficient. The size of holding is generally regarded as too small to bring sufficient returns to a farm family. The demand for casual labour, especially for cotton picking, has considerably increased. Many new tenants were former pickers in the Main Area before the Extension was developed. Furthermore, although the smaller holdings were designed to allow a tenant family to be self-sufficient in labour, some families received more than one holding, thus creating a demand for hired labour in competition with the tenants of the Main Area. The annual lease arrangement between the tenant and the other partners, as in the Main Area, has not helped to foster a long-term farming outlook, and there has been no inducement for the tenant to invest. Adequate credit, marketing and extension services are also lacking for crops other than cotton. Diseconomies of scale have also appeared in relation to factor management, resulting in increased costs. The cropping policy has not attempted to minimize Sudan's dependence on cotton, and there is also an incompatibility of outlook between tenants and the other partners. The development of the Extension has provided useful lessons for countries wishing to establish large scale schemes, but one central problem is the creation over time of a class of farmers who can take decisions at all levels of farm and business management.

The modernization of irrigation in the process of agriculture restructuring.,"","Abstract: The modernization of irrigation schemes in the Czech Republic reflects the fact that large co-operatives have been changed to smaller units such as joint-stock companies and family farms. This requires significant change in the way that irrigation schemes are laid out and managed. But this change is constrained by the insufficiency of grants/subsidies, by the cost of irrigation water and by the generally limited financial means. Such change will involve: (i) privatization of existing irrigation systems; (ii) modernization of pipe networks; (iii) re-evaluation of irrigation needs; (iv) changes in the efficiency of irrigation water use; (v) acquisition of cheap (profitable) water sources; (vi) introduction of new practices; (vii) construction of facilities for storing produce. ### Countries mentioned: Czechia ### Topics keywords: contract farming;irrigation scheme;water saving;small scale ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1999,,"Irrigation under conditions of water scarcity.

The natural and economic effects of establishment of production from the aspects of conservation of land resources in the region of the 'Bela Reka' watershed,"","Abstract: Agricultural production in the hilly Beli Potok watershed has led to soil erosion problems. Sediment resulting from erosion processes can contain different harmful organic and inorganic substances and therefore presents a source of pollutants of the soil and water resources in this area. Taking into consideration extensive erosion control works in the investigated region, structures in torrent channels, biological works and the construction of terraces for orchards in the watershed, as well as sustainable agriculture, the question is raised of ecological and economics effects of investments in erosion control. A model of soil management for sustainability is presented based on the degree of erosion hazard and the slope, as the basis for distribution of production lines. The proposal includes three types of crop rotation, self-terracing orchards, orchards with classical terraces, grassing and afforestation. In this way the soil resource can be conserved. One improvement proposes bee keeping in the established production lines of the offered sustainable production model. Economic efficiency of investments in sustainable soil management is satisfactory when assessed by discount methods--internal rate of return (IRR), pay back period (PBP), benefit-cost ratio and net present value (NPV). The sensitivity analysis was performed for the IRR parameter. This parameter is most sensitive to changes of benefit, thereafter to changes of regular production costs, and finally to investments in erosion control. The offered improvements in bee-keeping production will increase economic efficiency, and are very acceptable and adaptable for small farmers. It is an additional reason for people to stay in these lands. ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;crop rotation;drought stress;net return;SA;cost ratio;sustainable agriculture",1999,,"Investing in the protection of our environment.

The need for socio-economic and environmental indicators to monitor degraded ecosystem rehabiliation : a case study from Tanzania.,"","Abstract: This paper documents the events leading to the imminent collapse of an attempt to rehabilitate a degraded ecosystem in central Tanzania, focusing on the consequences of the failure to systematically monitor socio-economic and environmental indicators. A decision was taken in 1979 to evict all grazing livestock from a 1200 km2 semi-arid area, the so-called Kondoa Closed Area, in central Tanzania due to their destructive effect on contour ridges and bunds that had been constructed in an attempt to arrest land degradation. Although the closure was successful in that the vegetation quickly regenerated and soil erosion was arrested, the evictions resulted in severe hardship for the agro-pastoralists in the area. As a result, it was decided a decade later to allow the reintroduction of cattle on condition that they were totally confined and were of improved dairy breeds. Although performance and economic data have generally been positive, the top-down approach to the introduction of the cows, the lack of baseline data, followed by the withdrawal of external funding, have resulted in increased illegal free-grazing and the near collapse of the attempt to convert a degraded ecosystem to sustainable use. It is concluded that the probable collapse of the ecosystem in the Kondoa Closed Area is a result of the initial top-down approach to the introduction and implementation of the project, inadequate monitoring of socio-economic and environmental indicators, and ultimately to the withdrawal of donor funding. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Programs found: implementation project ### Topics keywords: environmental impact;soil erosion;LD;land degradation ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2001,,"Agriculture, ecosystems & environment",,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND23255759&site=ehost-live,,#37260,,"",""
The new independence? Ecological and economic problems in Central Asia.,"","Abstract: In the framework of production distribution within the former Soviet economy, the central Asian countries were primarily responsible for providing raw materials (energy, cotton, and cereals). The consolidation of self-sufficient economies in the newly independent republics is difficult. In Kazakhstan, most collective farms have been privatized, but the number of genuinely private agricultural operations remains small. High prices for agricultural inputs and low prices for agricultural products reduces yields. The government and the World Bank have developed concepts to improve the situation, although there are still environmental problems caused by irrigation, and the contamination of virgin land through mining and nuclear testing. In Uzbekistan major problems associated with agriculture are: poor yields, soil salinization, high water consumption, and low agricultural prices, although a project has been designed to contribute to sustainable, environmentally-friendly land use. ### Countries mentioned: Kazakhstan;Uzbekistan;Virgin Islands;Virgin Islands;United States ### Plant products search: cereals;cotton ### Topics keywords: land use;FAO;raw material ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD;BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1996,,Entwicklung + Ländlicher Raum,,,,,,,#37392,,"",""
The optimum rute of mechanization of farm labour.,"","Abstract: Analysis of long-term farm labour and farm management studies carried out under arable farming conditions in plain and hilly regions of Austria. The study is restricted to labour input in field work although the author recognizes the importance of mechanizing labour on the farmstead and improving its lay-out. The author distinguishes three stages of mechanization: (1) horse-drawn machinery, (2) partial motorization, (3) full motorization (no drought animals). Comparative study of costs shows that mechanization is likely to decrease labour expenses provided that a minimum period of machinery use is reached. The rate of utilization depends on the available area, i.e. on the size of the farm. Large peasant farms will find full mechanization, mainly based on the farmer's own machinery, profitable. Medium-sized peasant farms with an average labour force of two full-time workers have to face the fundamental problem of replacing horse-teams by a tractor while other machinery may be used co-operatively. Small peasant farms require high labour intensity in order to obtain high outputs per unit of area. They usually have to rely on special cultures which do not lend themselves easily to mechanization. In many cases the latter is also prohibitive for lack of investment capital.

The organization of production in the irrigated areas of the Sudan.,"","Abstract: Experience in the organization of people and resources into production units in irrigated agriculture is reviewed and conclusions drawn as to the kind of changes that seem desirable in the future both in the existing areas (35 million acres) and in the substantial extensions which are being planned. The way is described in which the broad, often blurred, human functions of entrepreneurship, management and manual labour are performed in the three main kinds of irrigation found in the Sudan: (1) the shaduf and water wheel which largely support subsistence family farming; (2) pump irrigation which is used with various types of organization from limited liabilities with share-cropping (resembling the Gezira model) or direct labour force, to small-scale cultivator partnerships and co-operatives; (3) the Gezira pattern of development (adopted in further government large-scale gravity-irrigation schemes) with its peculiar division of responsibilities, shared costs and returns for cotton, and rigidly and uniformly adhered to crop rotations. This last form of organization is seen to have advantages in the early stages of development under Sudan's conditions. It is argued (with examples) that there should be scope for later adjustments to relieve sources of conflict between government, development authorities and cultivators; to allow scope for individual initiative to encourage the fullest possible use of diverse talents and resources; and to facilitate adjustment to changing markets and technology.

The potato market in 1999 and at the beginning of 2000.,"","Abstract: Russia's potato production in 1999 remained at similar levels to 1998 despite drought during the growing period. However, deliveries onto the market were less, and this led to a higher rate of price increase. The market was stable early in 2000, but a further price rise was anticipated before the arrival of the new crop. The best yields in 1999 were in the north and north-west, the Urals, eastern and western Siberia. There was a further shift of production from the corporate to the private farming and smallholding sector, and this is expected to continue. In 1999 73.8% of the volume of sales was supplied by private producers. Some regions, where yields were lower, restricted movement of potatoes; others had a sufficient surplus to dispose of elsewhere. More potatoes were sold through markets or producers' trading networks and less to State procurement agencies, which were charged the highest prices. Demand remained high as potatoes continued to be a mainstay of many consumers' diet. Consumption of other, more expensive foods, notably meat and dairy products, declined further in 1999. 1999 prices were highest in the central-chernozem region at 3984 and lowest in eastern Siberia at 2448 roubles/tonne. ### Countries mentioned: Russian Federation ### Plant products search: potatoes ### Animal products search: meat ### Topics keywords: land use change;dairy industry;developing country ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2000,,Ekonomika Sel'skokhozyaistvennykh i Pererabatyvayushchikh Predpriyatii,,,,,,,#36625,,"",""

The rationale for using a watershed as the basis for planning and development,"","Abstract: A watershed is a logical, natural planning unit for agricultural, environmental and socioeconomic research and development. A watershed planning unit internalizes the costs of upland soil and water conservation activities with the benefits of such programs to downstream electricity generation, irrigation works, etc., thereby influencing the scope and assessment of the investment decisions. Research and development needs to integrate the vast reductionist-base information available on different production sectors into a broader, holistic approach. The primary considerations that are part of this holistic, watershed approach to planning and development are discussed in this chapter. Two case studies (a degraded, semiarid, agropastoral system in Niger and a steepland, subtropical, agropastoral system in Honduras) are used to illustrate the utility of using a watershed as unit for planning and implementation of development activities. -from Authors ### Countries mentioned: Honduras;Niger ### Programs found: benefit program ### Topics keywords: wastewater treatment;decision making;biogas production ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1995,,Agriculture and environment: bridging food production and environmental protection in developing countries,,,,,,,#37231,,"",""

The return of the wild.,"","Abstract: The world's problems have arisen from a steady trend towards concentration of economic power, expressed in greater centralization of government, procurement and marketing; growth of the urban population whose demands grow at the expense of the rural sector; and the steady amalgamation of land holdings to produce cash crops for world markets, destroying human communities and degrading the environment in the process. Agriculture in developing countries is increasingly being used to supply world markets for the benefits of national elites and the privileged elite in the international economic order, with a consequent decline in food production to the detriment of the general population. Such forces are also active within the UK and large numbers of family farms are facing crippling financial pressures. Those farms with capital to expand and intensify will survive and in the process will produce a simplified countryside with a narrower range of wildlife. The wealthier section of the urban population in the UK is now beginning the move back out into the countryside, which may have to accommodate another 5 million people by the year 2020. To achieve this without severe environmental degradation will require clear-headed and daring planning. An attempt to petrify the status quo will not suffice. Conservation, both in the UK and elsewhere, must begin with a people-based countryside. Deliberate measures are needed to guarantee land, resources and infrastructure to the family farm, together with encouragement to a vigorous and multifarious rural economy, which then feeds vigour and health back into the national economy and the whole community. In old societies like the UK, the established structure of landholding and control is disguised by social and cultural factors, above all, the class system; but it is just as much a block to fair provision of the means of life as in other parts of the world; and while its dismantling can be achieved without revolution or violence, determined and clear-sighted legal and fiscal measures must be taken to that end if economic, social and environmental health are to be re-established. ### Countries mentioned: United Kingdom ### Topics keywords: cover crop;developing country;rural community;rural household;rural tourism;cash crop;rural development;sweet potato;farming system;rural area;rural economy ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1987,,The return of the wild.,,,,,,,#36685,,"",""
The role and future use of perennial native grasses for temperate pastures in Australia.,"","Abstract: Increasingly in Australia there is evidence of pasture decline: acidification, salinization, and land degradation are all indicators that pastoral and landform ecosystems are not in equilibrium. With declining terms of trade for farmers, rapidly increasing costs of pasture establishment and maintenance, and an increased environmental awareness in the community, it is timely to consider the future and role of perennial native grasses in temperate pastures. The sowing of persistent, well-adapted, deep-rooted native or introduced grasses may reduce the rate of acidification or salinization. Native grasses evolved under conditions of a mostly dry and fluctuating climate, low nitrogen and phosphorus soils, low grazing pressure by soft-footed marsupial herbivores, low trampling pressure, high summer fire frequency, and low densities of legumes such as , , and . While introduced temperate perennial grasses often require a companion legume and fertilizer input for productivity and persistence, the adaptive characteristics of some native grasses may be useful, particularly in marginal environments where sown perennial grasses have poor persistence. In many districts, all native grasses were thought to have similar adaptive characters and so a philosophy evolved among many agriculturalists to replace indigenous plants with fertilized legume-based pastures. This assumed that the level of land capability could be permanently increased by adding introduced species to the pasture ecosystem, but there is increasing evidence that this may not be so. Where useful native grasses predominate, they have a continuing role as a major pasture resource on most properties. Some farmers on the Tablelands of New South Wales have developed stable and productive native grass-based pastures, carrying 8-15 dry sheep equivalent/ha, by manipulating grazing pressure, fertilizer use, and legume growth. In winter rainfall and cropping zones, such as the Riverina of New South Wales and the Mallee districts of Victoria, where native pastures occupy less than 25% of the agricultural land, native grasses are under test, because it is thought they are more likely than introduced species to have a restorative role in acidified, salinised, or degraded cropping lands. The availability of seed of the better native grasses by domestication and seed harvesting is seen as an adjunct to these roles, and not as providing replacements for other persistent, productive perennial grasses. ### Countries mentioned: United Kingdom;Australia;United States ### Plant products search: legumes ### Topics keywords: LD;NP;NPK;land degradation ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1994,,New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,,,#36592,,"",""
The role of agricultural technology in food and nutritional security in Africa.,"","Abstract: Agriculture, the most important industry in Africa, has not provided adequate food security and economic well-being for the continent's population. Agricultural production per capita and total exports declined since the 1970s, while population and urbanization increases resulted in growing demand. This inadequate performance was largely due to: (1) poor agricultural policies and management; (2) poor rural infrastructure, inadequate irrigation, and limited use of agricultural inputs; (3) civil strife; (4) weak regional collaboration and; (5) inadequate agricultural technology generation and delivery systems. However, Africa has the potential to achieve high productivity in agriculture. This is indicated by the high rate of return (ROR) to investment in research and extension and the recent positive response to favourable agricultural policies in a number of countries that are beginning to enhance productivity. To bring about sustained agricultural growth throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is argued that the above-mentioned constraints must be removed through: (1) continued improvement in the agricultural policy environment; (2) improvement in infrastructure (road and irrigation) and soil and water management and conservation; (3) enhanced input supply and distribution systems and; (4) strengthening of agricultural research and extension. The development and utilization of profitable and environmentally-friendly technology is an essential factor for the transformation of agriculture into a modern sector. The impact of technology can be attained through the revitalization of agricultural research and extension institutions, which requires: (1) broadening the base of agricultural research clientele to actively include farmers, private-sector agents and a variety of public related stakeholders; (2) adopting of a market-oriented strategic planning approach; (3) improving the organization and management to ensure accountability and transparency in planning, resource allocation and utilization, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment; (4) establishing sustainable and consolidated programming and financing mechanisms; and (5) strengthening regional collaboration. ### Topics keywords: SSA;private sector;contract farming;smallholder farmer;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2001,,African Journal of Food and Nutritional Security,,,,,,,#36756,,"",""
"The role of ants, birds and bats for ecosystem functions and yield in oil palm plantations","","Abstract: One of the world's most important and rapidly expanding crops, oil palm, is associated with low levels of biodiversity. Changes in predator communities might alter ecosystem services and subsequently sustainable management but these links have received little attention to date. Here, for the first time, we manipulated ant and flying vertebrate (birds and bats) access to oil palms in six smallholder plantations in Sumatra (Indonesia) and measured effects on arthropod communities, related ecosystem functions (herbivory, predation, decomposition and pollination) and crop yield. Arthropod predators increased in response to reductions in ant and bird access, but the overall effect of experimental manipulations on ecosystem functions was minimal. Similarly, effects on yield were not significant. We conclude that ecosystem functions and productivity in oil palm are, under current levels of low pest pressure and large pollinator populations, robust to large reductions of major predators. ### Countries mentioned: Indonesia ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: ecosystem service;ecosystem function;oil palm;specie richness;oil palm plantation ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2017,,ECOLOGY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1882,,#36299,,"",""

"The value of local economies and the centrality of food communities for a good, clean and fair agriculture.","","Abstract: The article examines the sociological issues related to the changes in the methods of production and consumption of food and agricultural products which has occurred in the last fifty years in industrialized countries. In particular, starting from the between the farmers of the past and the land, it is proposed to return to a sustainable form of production, avoiding desertification of the countryside and building a new rural sociality to meet the demands of new generations. To block the depopulation and desertification of the countryside there must be both a re-evaluation of the efficiency of agricultural systems (considering not only the monetary costs but also the ecological impact) and a shortening of the chain (the travel time of the product from the field to the table). It is necessary, therefore, to start from a healthy localism for all those types of foods that can be grown, raised and processed in limited geographical areas. All this is feasible through research for information and commitment of producers in describing their processes and movements of raw materials, thanks to the large-scale distribution - that however must rethink its system according to a greater localization - and also to ourselves and our desire to go back to being co-producers as once it was in peasant economies. ### Topics keywords: developing country;large scale;raw material",2012,,Rivista di Economia Agraria,,,,,,,#37119,,"",""
"The viability of the socio-economic sustainability of underdeveloped farmers in the Driefontein Area, North West Province.","","Abstract: Different arguments about the viability of underdeveloped farmers are going around. Many researchers and stakeholders were involved in projects aimed at improving the underdeveloped farmers' enterprises. Very few of the private or Government initiated projects paid any dividends to those involved. It appears that farmers lack the capability to incorporate the five components (biological viability, resources availability and viability, economic viability, social / community orientated viability and risk factors) necessary to manage a sustainable agribusiness. This study looks at present agricultural enterprises, the socio-economic components needed for a sustainable enterprise and how a sustainable enterprise should be managed by underdeveloped farmers. The study area was Driefontein which is situated in the north eastern part of the North West Province (25°55′E: 25°45′S). The average yearly rainfall over the period 2000 to 2007 was 325 mm. Of the 218 respondents 27% is involved in animal husbandry and 42% is involved in crop production. The remaining 31% is subsistence farmers and/or are involved within the farming community. The 218 farmers produce a total of 18 t of maize, 20 t sorghum and 7 t sunflower on a total of ±660ha, which proves the situation to be unsustainable according to the five pillars criteria for sustainable agriculture. The three input parameters representing the highest expenditure levels are fuel (R3 216), seed (R1 794) and labour (R1 335). Given the income they obtained from their crop production it is evident that the profit (per farmer) was R63 (maize), R235 (sorghum) and R64 (sunflower) per production season, respectively. The farmers indicated that the main reason for crop losses is drought, and to a minor extent damage caused by birds, stray animals, theft, diseases and pests. Damage caused by incompetency and monoculture practises are not considered a risk. However, if the potential farmers (semi-commercial and share croppers) receive training regarding sustainable agriculture, they will become accustomed to the complicacy regarding managing a sustainable agribusiness and can develop the needed skills necessary to manage a sustainable agribusiness. ### Plant products search: sorghum grain;maize ### Programs found: initiated project ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;SA;sustainable agriculture;drought stress",2009,,South African Journal of Agricultural Extension,,,,,,,#36617,,"",""
Theoretical and Applied Economics of Water Demand Management: All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Go,"","Abstract: Economists have advocated efficient use of water resources through the demand management tool of marginal cost (including opportunity cost) pricing policies for several decades, using increasingly sophisticated models to point out the welfare gains of this policies. More recently, water markets have become de rigueur in many articles, books and texts as a way to ""automatically"" include both delivery and opportunity costs. A review of the experience in both the developed and developing world, however, suggests that the adoption of these policies has been infrequent at best, particularly for irrigated agriculture. The objective of this paper is to review existing demand management activities in many countries, including the U.S., and to try to provide some understanding of the failure of water management agencies to employ these tools. Water subsidies for agricultural water are found in many developed countries, such as the United States, and widely among developing countries, even when water is in critically short supply. Most papers and reports describing the application of marginal cost pricing and/or water markets, the same few references appear over and over (Chile, Israel, and Australia, for example). Many authors suggest that the reason for the widespread absence of full marginal cost pricing and/or water markets lies in the rent seeking behavior of current beneficiaries and the inertia in water management systems. While these barriers are important, technical and institutional difficulties also play a critical role, especially in irrigated agriculture. Based on examples from many countries, it is clear that water measurement at the user level does not exist and that it will be costly to implement and maintain, reducing the ability of managers to apply efficient pricing. Moreover, creating water (use) rights also requires some form of water control and measurement at the user level. For systems with many very small farmers, the problem is multiplied substantially. Institutional barriers also are difficult to overcome. Some of these barriers, such as reluctant administrations and powerful lobbies, reflect, at least in part, the kind of rent-seeking and inertia economists (and others) often point out. Some involve the economic reality of long-term leasehold interest and consequent large losses of investment value. Some are related to institutions other than those for water, such as insecure and/or fragmented land tenure. Still others are cultural and social, and represent a broad consensus of society, rather than specific beneficiary groups. The many examples of the institutional and technical difficulties suggest that as demand management increasingly becomes the rhetoric of water economists, and the water management community in general, finding workable solutions to the those problems is absolutely essential if efficient water pricing and water markets are to be implemented. ### Countries mentioned: Israel;Australia;United States;Chile ### Topics keywords: developed country;irrigated agriculture;land reform;developing country;land degradation;water saving;developing world;land tenure;long term ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Latin America and the Caribbean;East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2004,,,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=0891738&site=ehost-live,,#37388,,"",""

"To each their own: case studies of four successful, small-scale organic vegetable farmers with distinct weed management strategies","","Abstract: Organic vegetable farmers execute weed management using many overall philosophies, including focusing management during the early-season critical period, managing the weed seedbank with a ‘zero seed rain’ strategy, or physically suppressing weeds with plastic or natural mulches. While these strategies vary in their ecological and economic implications, farmers’ reasons for adopting specific weed management approaches, and the related practical implications of each approach remain unclear. To better understand farmer motivations and ecological impacts of broad weed management philosophies, we conducted case studies of four successful organic vegetable farmers with specialization in different management approaches. The farmers were interviewed about their experiences and soil samples were collected for weed community and soil organic matter (SOM) analysis. The farmer who controls weed seedlings primarily during the critical period has appreciated the associated weeding labor savings, but late-season weeds have contributed to a large weed seedbank (38,482 seeds m−2), which is necessitating a change in his management. Conversely, the zero seed rain strategy of another farmer required a large amount of labor in the initial years, but weeding labor requirements have lessened every year due to decreased weed emergence from his diminishing weed seedbank (3065 seeds m−2). Another farmer utilizes plastic mulch in many crops in order to reduce weeding labor during the busy spring planting season. Finally, the farmer that uses natural mulches has high labor costs, but they are offset by the benefits of weed suppression, soil moisture conservation and increases to SOM. The two farmers utilizing mulch had the greatest portion of monocotyledonous weeds, perhaps relating to their morphology allowing them to emerge through the mulch. In ranking management criteria based on their importance, the case study farmers generally valued the criteria that are benefited by their strategy, indicating a strong relationship between their priorities and their management. Overall, there was no ‘best’ weed management strategy, but farmers may benefit from the consideration of how their management priorities match the practical tradeoffs of each strategy. ### Plant products search: vegetables ### Topics keywords: small scale;weed suppression;cover crop;spatial distribution;bulk density;EC;trace element;DM;DDT;OM;soil moisture;drinking water;SM;sample collected;heavy metal;organic matter;SOM",2017,,Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S1742170517000576,,#36534,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-12 07:25:31)(Screen): no mention of profitability / productivity outcomes or developing countries.; ,""
Too little too late: welfare impacts of rainfall shocks in rural Indonesia.,"","Abstract: The authors use regression analysis to assess the potential welfare impact of rainfall shocks in rural Indonesia. In particular, they consider two shocks: (i) a delay in the onset of monsoon and (ii) a significant shortfall in the amount of rain in the 90 day post-onset period. Focusing on households with family farm businesses, the analysis finds that a delay in the monsoon onset does not have a significant impact on the welfare of rice farmers. However, rice farm households located in areas exposed to low rainfall following the monsoon are negatively affected. Rice farm households appear to be able to protect their food expenditure in the face of weather shocks at the expense of lower nonfood expenditures per capita. The authors use propensity score matching to identify community programs that might moderate the welfare impact of this type of shock. Access to credit and public works projects in communities were among the programs with the strongest moderating effects. This is an important consideration for the design and implementation of adaptation strategies. ### Countries mentioned: Indonesia ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: work project;communitary program;community program;public work (PW) project ### Topics keywords: small scale;access credit;climate change;adaptation strategy;regression analysis;extension service;farm size;smallholder farmer;factor affecting ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2011,,Policy Research Working Paper - World Bank,,,,,,,#36684,,"",""
Toward a Satellite-Based System of Sugarcane Yield Estimation and Forecasting in Smallholder Farming Conditions: A Case Study on Reunion Island,"","Abstract: Estimating sugarcane biomass is difficult to achieve when working with highly variable spatial distributions of growing conditions, like on Reunion Island. We used a dataset of in-farm fields with contrasted climatic conditions and farming practices to compare three methods of yield estimation based on remote sensing: (1) an empirical relationship method with a growing season-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI, (2) the Kumar-Monteith efficiency model, and (3) a forced-coupling method with a sugarcane crop model (MOSICAS) and satellite-derived fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. These models were compared with the crop model alone and discussed to provide recommendations for a satellite-based system for the estimation of yield at the field scale. Results showed that the linear empirical model produced the best results (RMSE = 10.4 t.ha(-1)). Because this method is also the simplest to set up and requires less input data, it appears that it is the most suitable for performing operational estimations and forecasts of sugarcane yield at the field scale. The main limitation is the acquisition of a minimum of five satellite images. The upcoming open-access Sentinel-2 Earth observation system should overcome this limitation because it will provide 10-m resolution satellite images with a 5-day frequency. ### Countries mentioned: Reunion ### Plant products search: sugarcane ### Topics keywords: remote sensing;organic farming;land degradation;soil fertility;RS;essential oil;normalized difference vegetation index;winter wheat;NDVI;taking account;smallholder farming;vegetation index;rice straw;farming practice;farming system;long term;satellite image;VI;climatic condition;FAO;family farming;management practice;RMSE;EO;spatial distribution;growing season;soil moisture;smallholder farmer;GIS;sustainable agriculture",2014,,REMOTE SENSING,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/rs6076620,,#36744,,"",""
Towards a participatory research approach to improve goats production systems in semi arid Mexico: socioeconomic and ecological.,"","Abstract: The objective of this study was to identify research options which may lead to the improvement of goat productivity in a microwatershed involving two villages in the dry areas of northern Mexico. The study was carried out during 2004-2007 and was based on the systems theory. Socioeconomic and ecological aspects were evaluated at the macro-system level to identify socioeconomic differences and possible income generation options, to determine suitability of the area for goat production and to identify cropland areas to be reconverted to range production. In addition, the study assessed water erosion occurrence, evaluation of range vegetation and grazing quality changes to identify appropriate land management interventions. Poor participation of women in economic activities at the municipality level was a differentiating aspect that prompted recommendations for exploring gender-sensitive income-generation options (i.e. milk processing into highly demanded cheese). The microwatershed's 4914 ha of land were categorized as suitable for goat production systems, however in need of improvement interventions: results from water erosion and land degradation analysis identified 807 ha to be reconverted from agricultural uses to range and 208 ha from range use to native vegetation.

Towards a theoretical framework for sustainable smallholder irrigation farming: a case study of Lusip smallholder sugar-cane farmers in Swaziland.,"","Abstract: The government of Swaziland has fully recognized the role of smallholder irrigation development in poverty reduction hence intensive investments have been made to empower rural smallholder farmers through irrigation. The Lower Usuthu Irrigation Project (LUSIP) is one of the projects which strive to empower 2600 rural poor households to attain an improved quality of life and be able to sustain it. The study sought to interrogate the development model used at LUSIP and determine whether it guarantees sustainability of the development as well as to inform policy makers on the social and economic issues associated with the project. This was a case study using a qualitative research design where a purposive sample of the total operational farmers companies was selected for interviews. It can be concluded that the smallholder development under LUSIP has a potential to contribute to the overall agricultural contribution to the Swazi economy. The study unfolded issues around the farmer companies remaining in business and not being properly corporatized as well as uncertainty surrounding the land ownership and user rights though. Three broad recommendations include; corporatization of the farmer companies in a true sense, reviewing the participation-for-all model that is currently being used and the finalization of the National Land Policy by the government. ### Countries mentioned: Swaziland ### Plant products search: sugarcane ### Programs found: farm irrigation project;smallholder irrigation project (SIP);lower usuthu irrigation project (LUSIP);usuthu irrigation project;irrigation project ### Topics keywords: natural resource;land reform;developing country;land ownership;rural household;sugar beet;poverty reduction;sugar cane;willingness pay;decision making;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;policy maker;contract farming;raw material ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,African Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,,,#37204,,"",""
"Towards enhanced soil and kale (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Brassica oleracea</i>) productivity through application of organic fertilizers and legume integration in farming systems of Kabete sub-County, Kenya.","","Abstract: In this study, the influence of farm yard manure (FYM) and Minjingu Rock Phosphate (MRP) application, and chickpea ( L.) and white lupin ( L) integration as intercrop and/or in rotation with kale on N, P and soil organic C levels and balances, and Kale yields was evaluated. The on station field experiment was conducted during the short and long rain seasons of 2014. The experimental layout was a RCBD with a split-plot arrangement replicated thrice. The treatments consisted of sole kale, kale intercropped and/or in rotation with chickpea and white lupin (as main plots). The spilt plots were; (i) FYM (ii) MRP and (iii) Control (CTRL). The soil total N and P were significantly (P≤0.05) higher in lupin/kale intercrop with application of FYM and MRP, respectively. A similar trend in total N and plant available P was registered in short rain season. There were no significant changes in soil organic C levels across cropping systems and organic fertilizers in both seasons. Positive full N balances were realized in crop rotation systems with application of FYM whereas negative partial (organic fertilizers - kale harvests) N balances were recorded across cropping systems and organic inputs except for sole kale system with application of FYM. Positive full and partial P balances were obtained across cropping systems with application of MRP. Higher kale yields were realized in lupin-kale rotation (FYM and MRP); chickpea-kale rotation (FYM and MRP) and kale monocrop (FYM). Integration of white lupin and chickpea with the application of FYM and MRP in a kale cropping system led to significant improvement in soil total N, plant available P and organic C. The improved soil nutrient status contributed to improved kale yields. Kales grown in rotation and/or intercrop with white lupin with chickpea and MRP or FYM application would therefore be a sustainable strategy for enhanced kale production in smallholder farming systems. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: brassica;lupin;white lupin;chickpeas;leafy vegetables ### Programs found: mahanadi reservoir project (MRP);magdalena river project (MRP);mega rice project (MRP) ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;experiment conducted;cropping system;EC;soil fertility;randomized complete block design;dry matter;TN;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;NH4;smallholder farming;field experiment;NO3;flow rate;farmyard manure;farming system;crop rotation;significant difference;soil organic carbon;OC;farm yard manure;TP;field experiment conducted;organic fertilizer;plant height;growing season;FYM;smallholder farmer;DAS;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2018,,Thünen Report,,,,,,,#37650,,"",""
Traditional agricultural gardens conserve wild plants and functional richness in arid South Sinai.,"","Abstract: Maintaining agricultural diversity is important for the conservation of rare species and for preserving underlying ecosystem processes on which smallholder farmers rely. The positive effects of crop diversity are well documented in tropical systems, but the conservation potential of arid agricultural systems is less clear. This study assesses the impact of three arid agroforestry systems on plant diversity and functional richness in South Sinai, Egypt: (1) mountain orchard gardens, (2) modern town gardens and (3) low desert date-palm gardens. We surveyed plants (cultivated and wild) within gardens and control plots of natural habitat and allocated each plant eight biological traits that are recognised as being linked with major ecosystem processes. Species diversity was quantified using three measures (Hill's numbers) and total species diversity was significantly higher within gardens than in the surrounding habitat at all three levels of diversity and across the three agroforestry systems. Species similarity was high between gardens and the surrounding habitat, and there was a strong overlap in the functional traits of wild plants and cultivated non-tree species. Despite the clear presence of trees within the gardens, the community weighted trait means (CWMs) showed that chamaephyte perennials were the dominant life-forms in both the gardens and the natural habitat. Functional richness differed between the three agroforestry systems, but was significantly higher within the gardens. Functional richness has been linked to increased productivity and CWMs showed that plants within the gardens were considerably taller than outside, suggesting higher biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that Bedouin agricultural practices are not having a negative effect on the flora of the region and that the continuation of these indigenous farming practices can actively benefit rare wild plants in the region. On a wider scale, this study supports the view that smallholder farms and homegardens can be valuable tools in conservation, preserving local species and maintaining ecosystem functioning. ### Countries mentioned: Egypt ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Topics keywords: short term;organic farming;plant height;land degradation;human health;point view;negative effect;factor influencing;human activity;agroforestry system;factor affecting;farming practice;smallholder farmer;farming system;AFS;sustainable agriculture;management practice ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,Basic and Applied Ecology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2013.10.004,,#37569,,"",""
Traditional agroforestry practice in Limpopo Province of South Africa,"","Abstract: Agroforestry practices are widespread among resource-poor farmers in the Limpopo Province, yet information on this land use system is minimal. A general survey was undertaken through site visits and structured questionnaire to generate information on structure, components, management and socio-economic issues on the agrisilvicultural and agrisilvopastoral systems among the farmers in diverse agroecological zones of the province. The following annual rainfall distribution was used to classify specific agroforestry in the communities: very low ( < 500 mm), low (500-600), medium (601-800) and high (801-1000) annual rainfall. Results from the survey revealed that, tree and shrub species are retained on croplands for various reasons across rainfall zones. Major concerns on adopting agroforestry include the lack of land ownership to accommodate long term investment in trees, lack of knowledge and support on agroforestry, interference on annual crops by trees and livestock. Despite the challenges, most farmers interviewed have strong interest in intensive agroforestry systems. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: land reform;drought stress;SA;land ownership;land use;agroforestry system;AFS;agroforestry practice;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2018,,Journal of Human Ecology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.31901/24566608.2018/62.1-3.2941,,#36466,,"",""
"Traditional beekeeping and its impact, as part of a subsistence economy, on the savanna woodlands and forests in the Zambezian domain, south-central and east Africa.","","Abstract: This study is based on a literature review of traditional beekeeping in E. and southern Africa and its impact on savanna woodlands; there are 170 references. Savanna woodland ecology, including climate, vegetation, agricultural activities, forest products, and other uses (e.g. hunting, fishing), is described. This is followed by a general description of the honey bees (, ) found in these woodlands, their behaviour and biology, and their efficiency in exploiting natural resources. An outline of the history of traditional beekeeping in savanna woodlands is given, followed by details of methods and equipment used, including log hives, bark hives, other hive types, bait hives for swarm capture, and siting of hives. The role of beekeeping in a subsistence economy is analysed. The final four chapters discuss the potential of the savanna woodlands for beekeeping, the effects of development projects on beekeeping and the effects of beekeeping on the woodlands, and give conclusions and recommendations. A more comprehensive approach to investigating the impact of beekeeping on the savanna woodlands is suggested. Two appendixes give an explanation of climatic diagrams and the scientific names of flora and fauna mentioned in the thesis. ### Animal products search: honey ### Programs found: development project;effect development project ### Topics keywords: pest control;natural resource;honey bee;risk assessment",1992,,"Traditional beekeeping and its impact, as part of a subsistence economy, on the savanna woodlands and forests in the Zambezian domain, south-central and east Africa.",,,,,,,#36191,,"",""

Trends and perceptions of rural household groundwater use and the implications for smallholder agriculture in rain-fed Southern Laos,"","Abstract: In Laos, the extent of rural groundwater use is largely unknown. This paper presents results of a study conducted in Champasak province, Southern Laos, to examine rural household attitudes to groundwater use and management; and to gauge farmer perceptions of the opportunities/constraints of increased groundwater use for smallholder agriculture. Significant differences in groundwater use, total cash income and perceived groundwater quality were found. Further agricultural expansion was constrained by insufficient labour and the limited area of individual landholdings, not by the limited groundwater supply, which was the preferred source to fulfil increased demands for domestic/agricultural use. There were no groundwater regulations. ### Countries mentioned: Lao People's Democratic Republic ### Topics keywords: land degradation;rural household;significant difference;farmer perception;extension service;smallholder farmer;management practice ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2015,,International Journal of Water Resources Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2015.1015071,,#37376,,"",""

Uncertainty and allocative behaviour in peasant agriculture: a study of small-holding farmers in Bangladesh.,"","Abstract: The study analyzes farmer behaviour in Bangladesh, focusing on the effects that risk has on resource allocation decisions. In peasant agriculture where the farms are extremely small and cultivation is dependent upon highly variable rainfall, the farm family may be preoccupied not with maximizing income but with maximizing their chances of survival. Based on the allocative efficiency conditions derived from the safety-first model, alternative testable hypotheses are developed to ascertain whether small farmers in Bangladesh efficiently allocate their resources to various crops in the presence of risk. A comparison of resource allocation behaviour under two rival criteria for analyzing decision making under uncertainty shows that it is possible to analyze the risk preferences of the farm household in a safety-first model much in the same way as in an expected utility model. The interpretation of the risk coefficient, however, will be somewhat different for the safety-first model. Emphasizing the farmer's behaviour towards risk, the safety-first approach attempts to explain, in terms of subsistence needs and income generating capacity of the farm households, whether the household is 'forced to gamble' or 'allowed to accept less risk' in their choice of crop portfolio. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh ### Topics keywords: technical efficiency;decision making;farm size ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1983,,"Dissertation Abstracts International, A",,,,,,,#36180,,"",""
Special programme for food security as a concept to alleviate rural poverty.,"","Abstract: The Special Programme for Food Security (SPFS) was launched in Indonesia to alleviate rural poverty and food security as a response to declining of agriculture production.

Status and economics of freshwater aquaculture in selected countries of Asia.,"","Abstract: The paper discusses the status of freshwater aquaculture, and the productivity and cost effectiveness of alternative technologies in the major fish producing countries in Asia, such as Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The analysis is based on field survey data collected by the WorldFish Center and its partner research institutes, and supplemented by secondary information. The paper adopts descriptive techniques to compare the performance of each technology across the countries in terms of productivity, cost effectiveness and profitability. Results suggest that freshwater fish farming is generally profitable in Asia. The semi-intensive polyculture and monoculture of omnivorous and herbivorous species like carps and tilapia are likely to be more suitable for adoption by the poor farmers in Asia. Although the return from monoculture of carnivorous species such as prawn, snakehead and walking catfish is higher than that from culture of omnivorous and herbivorous species, it appears too capital intensive to be suitable for adoption by the resource poor farmers. The paper also performs econometric analysis to examine the determinants of fish production under polyculture and feed demand for the same. The results of the production function analysis reveal that further use of farm-based feed after a certain level of application cannot increase productivity as the law of diminishing marginal productivity sets in. Feed use is largely determined by the income and ownership status of the farmer. Provision of institutional credit and more secured access to the waterbodies would help poor farmers adopt appropriate aquaculture technologies. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh;Thailand;Philippines;Viet Nam;Indonesia;India;China ### Animal products search: tilapia;fish;carp ### Topics keywords: factor influencing;factor affecting;BMP ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD",2005,,Aquaculture Economics & Management,,,,,,,#37029,,"",""
Supply response and investments in agriculture in Andhra Pradesh.,"","Abstract: The study explored the response of aggregate farm output, input use, and farm investment decisions to output and input prices, wages, technological change, public investments, and climatic factors using district-level panel data of over 39 years from Andhra Pradesh. It confirms the low, short-run aggregate output supply elasticity of Indian agriculture as found in the literature. It validates the hypothesis that the relationships between public investment, financial institutions, and farm investment of labor and capital in agriculture have not changed over the years. The empirical estimates of aggregate output supply elasticity with respect to output price (0.2), roads (0.2), markets (0.11), and net irrigated area (0.05) are higher than previous findings for selected states in India. Aggregate agricultural output responds positively to credit availability (represented by banks) and canal irrigation, each with an elasticity of 0.01. The wage elasticity (0.3) on aggregate output is higher than price elasticity (0.2), indicating that the effects of rising wages outweigh the incentives offered by output price support. Climatic factors (e.g., rainfall) significantly affect fertilizer use and aggregate output while deviation from normal rainfall adversely affects aggregate output. The study substantiates previous findings that public investment in infrastructure and financial institutions respond to the agriculture potential and agro-climatic endowments of an area. A renewed focus, therefore, is required for better targeting of public investments in areas that are relatively resource poor and have harsh agro-climatic conditions for a more inclusive growth and rural poverty reduction. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Measurements for interventions: price support ### Topics keywords: short term;developing country;winter wheat;short run;rural household;growing season;rural poverty;climatic condition;taking account;factor influencing;long term;poverty reduction ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2012,,Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development,,,,,,,#37609,,"",""
Symposium on Access to Finance: Patterns of Rainfall Insurance Participation in Rural India,"","Abstract: Take-up of an innovative rainfall insurance policy offered to smallholder farmers in rural India decreases with basis risk between insurance payouts and income fluctuations, increases with household wealth, and decreases with binding credit constraints. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple neoclassical model with borrowing constraints. Other patterns are less consistent with the benchmark model. For example, participation in village networks and measures of familiarity with the insurance vendor are strongly correlated with insurance take-up decisions, and risk-averse households are less, not more, likely to purchase insurance. These results may reflect household uncertainty about the product, given their limited experience with it. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: crop insurance;smallholder farmer;natural resource ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2008,,World Bank Economic Review,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1018097&site=ehost-live,,#37344,,"",""
"Symposium on some Aspects of Hemorrhagie Fevers in the Americas. Presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, New York City, 5 Nov. 1964.","","Abstract: In the introductory review paper of this symposium A. SHELOKOV (p. 790) traces the recognition of haemorrhagic fevers in different parts of the world in recent years, of different virus aetiology, with different vectors, and with different clinical syndromes. The two new American fevers may provisionally be classified as "" zoonotic "", man being infected directly from rodents or possibly by way of a rodent parasite. Argentinian haemorrhagic fever was first recognized in 1955, at Junin, near Buenos Aires, and a virus, named Junin was isolated from patients, from rodents, and from mites. Since then from 300 to 1, 000 cases have been reported each year with a variable mortality, up to 20%, and the disease apparently is gradually spreading. The Bolivian disease was first recognized in 1959, in the northeastern province of Beni, and in 1963 the causal virus, called Machupo, was isolated from patients and rodents during an urban epidemic in the town of San Joaquin. The two viruses are related anti-genically and produce similar clinical syndromes in man, with signs attributable to haematopoietic and capillary damage, with variable localization of lesions. A related virus, Tacaribe, has been frequently isolated from bats in Trinidad, but does not apparently infect other animals or man, while in 1964 another related virus was isolated from rodents in Amapá Territory, near Belém, Brazil. was sufficient to produce antibodies; although not as susceptible as guineapigs in Argentina, which have been used for the isolation and propagation of Junin virus, it is probable that multiplication of virus occurred in these animals. The 3 strains of Junin virus were indistinguishable from each other in the tests, but the strain of Tacaribe virus could easily and consistently be distinguished from the Junin strains on the basis of the serum titres. The greater differences, up to 8-fold, were seen when Junin antisera were reacted with the different antigens. in contrast to the findings in complement-fixation tests. 10 sera from patients with Machupo virus infection in Bolivia failed to give any neutralization of Tacaribe or Junin viruses in plaque tests. H 8.0. were stable at 4°C. Preliminary attempts to find a haemagglutinin were unsuccessful. Machupo virus was inoculated into various tissue cultures, but a cytopathic effect was found only in cultures of the WI-26 strain of human embryo lung with a readable end-point 7-12 days after inoculation. For virus isolation from field material infant hamsters were more sensitive than mice or WI-26 cultures, and no isolations were made in the last which were not also obtained in hamsters. The isolation rate in hamsters was not increased by blind passage of brains. It was, however, found possible to use WI-26 cultures for neutralization tests, but it was necessary to use unheated guineapig serum as the diluent for the test serum in order to obtain consistent results. This caused an increase of 16- to 32-fold in the antibody titre of immune sera when used instead of buffered saline as diluent. Some of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the virus were investigated. Lack of inhibition by 5-bromodeoxyuridine suggested the presence of ribonucleic acid in the core and excludes the virus from the adenovirus, pox virus, papovavirus, and herpes simplex groups, while sensitivity to chloroform excludes it from the picornavirus and reovirus groups. It was found to be stable within the pH range of 6 to 9 and to be only moderately sensitive to heat, while on storage at -70°C it was stable for at least 6 months if a protein supplement were added to the diluent. Gradocol membrane filtration experiments suggested an upper limit of size of 180 mμ,. Cross-CF tests failed to disclose any relationship with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or with a large number of myxoviruses. Classification of the virus must await detailed study of its size and structure. . No virus isolations were obtained from over 28, 000 specimens tested of the great variety of species of tropical arthropods in the area, including rodent ectoparasites, or from 271 bats of various species or from 27 other rodents. is a pastoral species, inhabiting the grasslands and forest edges, and readily invades houses. It was found typically in farm villages in elevated forest clearings overlooking the grass-covered marshlands or "" savannas "". In contrast, it was not found in the other common type of human settlement, the port villages in gallery forest on river banks, where several other species of rodents predominated in houses. Cases of haemorrhagic fever in man occurred only in the former ecological setting, but it is mentioned that some positive CF test results had been obtained with rodent sera from areas other than where infections had been found in man. In May 1964 a rodent extermination scheme was started in San Joaquín which included the use of traps, poison baits, and the dusting of burrows with insecticide. Over 3, 000 rodents were known to have been destroyed, including more than 2, 800 between May and July. The incidence of haemorrhagic fever in human beings fell dramatically and no case was recorded after June 1964. These results further suggested that arthropods were not important as biological vectors of the disease. was established; no sickness was produced by inoculation of adult animals but virus appeared in the urine after 15 days and was present for at least 100 days, while viraemia and the development of a low titre of neutralizing antibodies were also demonstrated. Further isolations were made from towards the end of the epidemic, 13 of 17 wild-caught specimens yielding virus from the spleen or kidney. From the facts which have been established a hypothesis is derived about the genesis of the epidemic. From 1959 to 1963, springing from an unknown source, haemorrhagic fever spread through the villages in commercial touch with San Joaquin, owing to contact of human beings with infected . Some time before the end of 1962 infection was introduced into the. population of San Joaquin, by the importation of infected rodents in baggage, by their direct migration, or by contact with some other feral animal. Since infection in was chronic multiplication of this animal, unchecked by a normal cat population which had inadvertently been reduced in the town, possibly by DDT poisoning, resulted in a slow spread of new foci of infection. This was communicated to man by direct contamination of food, water, or air by virus continually excreted by infected rodents. This hypothesis accords with the peculiar temporal and geographical pattern of human disease, with the isolation of virus from the urine and tissues of with the inability to isolate virus from any arthropod, even those closely associated with that rodent, and with the dramatic results of the anti-rodent campaign. The ecology of Machupo virus outside human communities is still largely unknown.

The impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security: The case of Filtino and Godino irrigation schemes in Ethiopia [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Ethiopia's irrigation potential is estimated at 3.7 million hectare, of which only about 190,000 ha (4.3% of the potential) is actually irrigated. There is little information on the extent to which the so far developed irrigation schemes have been effective in meeting their stated objectives of attaining food self-sufficiency and eradicating poverty. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to identify the impact of small-scale irrigation on household food security based on data obtained from 200 farmers in Ada Liben district of Ethiopia in 2006. The resulting data was analyzed using Heckman's Two-step Estimation procedure. Studies elsewhere revealed that access to reliable irrigation water can enable farmers to adopt new technologies and intensify cultivation, leading to increased productivity, overall higher production, and greater returns from farming. Our study findings confirm some of these claims. In the study area about 70% of the irrigation users are food secure while only 20% of the non-users are found to be food secure. Access to small scale irrigation enabled the sample households to grow crops more than once a year; to insure increased and stable production, income and consumption; and improve their food security status. The study concludes that small-scale irrigation significantly contributed to household food security. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Measurements for interventions: irrigation ### Topics keywords: small scale;small scale irrigation scheme;food insecurity;million hectare;arable land;water saving;household food security;self sufficiency;food secure;irrigation scheme;farming system;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2008,,Irrigation and drainage systems,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44084937&site=ehost-live,,#36509,,"",""
The importance of water security for sustainable development in the Romanian agri-food sector.,"","Abstract: In this paper, we shall resume some of our research in the field of water security and sustainable economic development. Therefore, we define and further analyze the concept of water security, highlighting its actual increased importance for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. While the global demand for food is rising, there are several actors that will critically limit food production: the increased urbanization, the rising prices on inputs, the pressure on water resources and the increased crops and livestock vulnerability to climate change. We may find a strong link between water security and food security, in the global resource nexus model. These issues are shown to be important also in Romania, in our times of climate change and of increased small-scale farmers' vulnerability. In agreement with the experts and considering the strategic relevance of these aspects, we aim to stress more on the importance of investment in water infrastructure in the rural areas of Romania, to achieve the water security required for a sustainable agri-food and rural development. Moreover, we highlight directions of integrated water management in view of a green economy. As a main recommendation is the need to implement programs and policies promoting water security, as well as water resource efficiency in the Romanian agriculture and rural development programs. ### Countries mentioned: Romania ### Programs found: rural development program (RDP);rural development (RD) program;development program;economic development (ED) program;sustainable development (SD) program ### Topics keywords: EU;contract farming;poverty alleviation;rural household;special issue;taking account;agri food;RDP;small scale;agro food;rural development;rural area;food security;cover crop;climate change;sustainable development;extension service;small scale farmer;CC ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2015,,Agriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.08.120,,#36595,,"",""
The integrated rural development programme of India.,"","Abstract: The paper was presented at the Annual Conference of the UK Development Studies Association, held at the University of East Anglia, 15-17 September 1986. It traces the origins of the IRDP as a reaction to the trickle-down approach which characterized the strategy for rural development in India during the early post-Indepencence period. The Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) was introduced in April 1978, initially integrating the Small Farmer Development Agency (SFDA), the Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), the Command Area Development Authority (CADA) and Operation Flood Stage II, which together covered some 2300 blocks. In October 1980, the IRDP was extended to cover all 5011 blocks throughout India. The paper describes the main features of IRDP and some evaluation studies of the programme which have indicated specific weaknesses in the selection of beneficaries, choice of project, and adminstrative structure. Detils are then presented of IRDP under the 7th plan (1985-90) which include revised guidelines and a new system of concurrent evaluation. A deeper critism of IRDP is that it is based on a top-down and paternalistic approach to the nature of rural development. It is concluded that if IRDP is to succeed, it can only happen within the context of parallel changes in the socio-economic structure of rural India. The two most important changes in this respect are considered to be the implementation of the Minimum Wage (Rural Areas) Act and land ceiling regulations of the Land Reform Act. For both these changes, the autonomous political organization of the poor peasantry is a prerequisite. ### Countries mentioned: India;United Kingdom ### Programs found: drought prone area program (DPAP);development study program;rural development program (RDP);area development program (ADP);farmer development program;rural area development (RAPD) program;small farmer development program (SFDP);integrated rural development program (IRDP);rural development (RD) program;farm development program;development program ### Topics keywords: rural development;rural area;land reform;RDP ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1986,,"Papers in the Administration of Development, Development Administration Group, Institute of Local Government Studies, University of Birmingham",,,,,,,#36749,,"",""
The Leverhulme Trust. The West Africa Commission 1938-1939. Technical reports.,"","Abstract: Part I of this report which deals with crop production and soil fertility problems, although perhaps of more specific interest to agriculturists, contains much of general interest to the colonial veterinarian. On pages 34-36 the subject of mixed farming with its benefits is briefly discussed, with the conclusion that its general application is unlikely to be successful owing to difficulties of climate, disease and the tsetse fly. [Many colonial veterinary officers would disagree with this.] , ""Sokota Reds"", having an international reputation for quality. Chapter III considers the conditions under which cattle are kept, and bred and their possible improvement. The potentials of the great fertile stretches and fine pasture lands of Northern Nigeria and the French territory between Nigeria and the Sudan, common grazing grounds for Fulani stock-owners, are stressed; the utilization of these potentially rich livestock areas depends upon the control of disease, the provision of water supplies and the improvement of the productivity of the pastures; when these have been accomplished, breed improvement by selection will become possible. The discussion which follows on conditions in Nigeria alone includes an enlightened plea for the recognition of the value of the goat, particularly of its position in small holdings and the difficulty of finding a suitable substitute in the family menage. The goats are the property of the women of the house and play a prominent part in ceremonial usage. Their prolificacy, their milk and the quality of their flesh are greatly appreciated by the villagers. The menace of the goat to agriculture seems to have been greatly exaggerated; African cultivators do not permit their goats to damage food crops and tether them during the growing season. Chapter IV describes the systems of marketing and distribution in vogue as ""admittedly inefficient and extremely wasteful"". The improvement of stock routes and provision of means of transport of dressed carcasses are recommended to reduce the wastage. [A more recent report from Nigeria (1942) records a great improvement in rail transport during the war.] According to the official census, the cattle population in Nigeria is only just over three millions but from figures available as to meat consumption and export of hides it appears to be more in the region of five and a half millions, a fine potential if present avoidable wastage can be reduced and distribution organized. Improvement in the marketing of hides and skins in native Africa has not kept pace with improved methods of preparation; it is felt that traders do not generally encourage the improved methods of preparation demonstrated by the Veterinary Department for many years. The sociological aspect of RINDERPEST is dealt with on p. 76. Heavy loss of stock is calamitous in an African community and Government action which is effective in its prevention is well calculated to gain the confidence of peoples otherwise indifferent. It is claimed that the veterinary services have established this confidence in parts of Nigeria and the Gold Coast. Chapter VI constitutes a plea for a joint effort by all governments concerned to eradicate the two major cattle-limiting diseases in Africa, RINDERPEST and BOVINE CONTAGIOUS PLEURO-PNEUMONIA, as a necessary preliminary to development of the huge animal potential in equatorial Africa. During recent years conferences on the question of rinderpest control have been held,. jointly by the administration, of different territories under British control in which representatives of French and Belgian administrations in Africa have joined, and the necessity of joint action has been stressed. A centrally placed laboratory for the manufacture of biological products would go a long way to solve the outstanding problem of economic production. Chapter VII gives notes on game preservation in the West African dependencies suggesting that game preservation should be confined to large unfarmed areas and abandoned in the rest of the country where rare species can be protected by a revival of the old tribal hunting laws and a system of regional licences. Game- in Nigeria under present conditions do not justify adoption of orthodox and expensive game preservation measures as a business proposition. [Much that has been written in this report with regard to the livestock potential and its future development in West Africa applies almost equally well to the East African dependencies which, if included in any development scheme, would raise the very conservative estimate of 10 million cattle to an even more conservative estimate of some 20 millions at present supplying a mere fraction of their utilitarian capacity for the benefit of both man and the soil, even wichin their own boundaries]-S.

The long term prospects of Indian agricultural growth. A case study approach by crops: 1951-1976.,"","Abstract: Factors in Indian agricultural growth and patterns of consumption of fertilizers, particularly by small and marginal farmers, are analyzed. Agricultural growth has at no time or in any region been uniform and much of the interest in studying past patterns rests in the large differences in the elements of dynamism. Figures are given of productivity and production of each crop. Agriculture developed rapidly from 1966-67 onwards but lapsed into a relatively stationary state between 1970-71 and 1975-76. It is believed that irrigation and fertilizer use are the key neglected factors. The long-term prospects for both are now good. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: NDVI;cover crop;long term ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1976,,"Quarterly Economic Report, Indian Institute of Public Opinion",,,,,,,#36903,,"",""
The making of new Powerguda: community empowerment and new technologies transform a problem village in Andhra Pradesh.,"","Abstract: Public participation in government programmes and empowerment of women has been the cornerstone of state policy in Andhra Pradesh, India. The creation of half a million hamlet-level thrift groups headed by women, known popularly as self-help groups (SHGs), has empowered local communities and served as an important social instrument in the fight against poverty. Public investment in watershed management and new agricultural technologies are helping to transform the livelihoods of poor farmers, and in particular indigenous communities. This case study documents the transformation of Powerguda, a village of 32 families in Adilabad district, Andhra Pradesh. As a result of watershed management, new agricultural technologies and community empowerment, average household income increased by 77% over three years. The report identifies the key drivers of economic, social and institutional growth in the village, which offer possibilities for replication in other parts of the semi-arid tropics where 350 million people live in poverty. The growth drivers include community empowerment, local government support and financial linkages to leverage community savings into productive public investment. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Programs found: local government (LG) program;government program ### Topics keywords: natural resource;local community;land degradation;SHG;rural community;rural household;rural tourism;protected area;household income;large scale;dairy farming;social capital ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2004,,The making of new Powerguda: community empowerment and new technologies transform a problem village in Andhra Pradesh,,,,,,,#36177,,"",""
"The meat crisis: Developing more sustainable and ethical production and consumption, second edition","","Abstract: Meat and dairy production and consumption are in crisis. Globally, 70 billion farm animals are used for food production every year. It is well accepted that livestock production is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) predicts a rough doubling of meat and milk consumption in the first half of the 21st century, with particularly rapid growth occurring in the developing economies of Asia. What will this mean for the health and wellbeing of those animals, of the people who consume ever larger quantities of animal products, and for the health of the planet itself? The new edition of this powerful and challenging book explores the impacts of the global growth in the production and consumption of meat and dairy, including cultural and health factors, and the implications of the likely intensification of farming for both small-scale producers and for animals. Several chapters explore the related environmental issues, from resource use of water, cereals and soya, to the impact of livestock production on global warming and issues concerning biodiversity, land use and the impacts of different farming systems on the environment. A final group of chapters addresses ethical and policy implications for the future of food and livestock production and consumption. Since the first edition, published in 2010, all chapters have been updated, three original chapters re-written and six new chapters added, with additional coverage of dietary effects of milk and meat, antibiotics in animal production, and the economic, political and ethical dimensions of meat consumption. The overall message is clearly that we must eat less meat to help secure a more sustainable and equitable world. ### Plant products search: cereals ### Animal products search: meat;milk ### Topics keywords: small scale;GHG emission;climate change;united nation;environmental impact;land use;LCA;small scale producer;agriculture organization united;N2O;CO2;CH4;FAO;greenhouse gas;farming system;global warming;greenhouse gas emission;GHG",2017,,"The Meat Crisis: Developing More Sustainable and Ethical Production and Consumption, Second Edition",,,,,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315562032,,#36713,,"",""

The pecan-growing industry in Israel.,"","Abstract: An account is presented of pecan production in Israel from both the husbandry and economic aspects. The crop was first introduced in the early 1930s. From the late 1950s to the mid-1960s some 1,500 acres were planted, mostly in plots of 3-5 acres, and there has since been only little change in this pattern. At present there is only one sizeable orchard of 400 acres, another of 100 acres and about two dozen of 20-40 acres. New pecan orchards are still planted mainly by smallholders, most of whom are unaccustomed to detailed economic considerations before making their investment. Their attitude towards planting of pecans seems to be influenced by the present market situation. In addition, the pecan has been looked upon as a good complementary crop in small farms raising poultry or green-house crops, or engaged in other highly intensified branches; on such farms land and water could be allocated to a crop which seems to need little care. However, bigger operators in agriculture, such as collective farms (kibbutzim), who are accustomed to a more careful examination of investments, have in recent years hesitated to plant pecans. Their reservations have been due mainly to the lack of long-term local experience with the production potential of an orchard, the uncertain prospects of fully mechanized harvesting and the difficulties in forecasting returns. The existing yearly rate of planting (approximately 800 acres) is not expected to increase in the near future. The situation may, however, be changed considerably by the new varieties, by a break-through in harvest techniques and by intensified research. ### Countries mentioned: Israel ### Plant products search: pecans ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: orchard ### Topics keywords: attitude towards;GM;long term;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1976,,Israel Agriculture,,,,,,,#37169,,"",""
The production improvement of native chickens 1. Comparison of two feeding systems in two areas.,"","Abstract: The effect of 2 feeding systems was compared in 2 areas, Jaehom district, Lampang Province and Doisaket district, Chiang Mai province, Thailand, using the 2×2 factorial arrangement in CRD. Six and 8 small holder farmers in Lampang and Chiang Mai, respectively, were selected to join the project. The farmers in each area were divided into 2 groups. In the first group, the hens and cockerels were kept in confinement all the time and were fed with commercial laying feeds while the second group received carbohydrate feed (broken rice and rice bran; BRB) in the morning when males and females were kept together in confinement before scavenging in the afternoon. The chicks were separated from their mothers shortly after hatching. Then, the hens were soaked in water everyday until the laying of the next clutch of eggs. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of feeding systems and areas, except for lower body weight loss of hens and shorter laying interval of the group fed with laying feed (12.0 vs. 13.0 days after hatching, respectively). The hens needed soaking for 5.6 days to start remitting and another 6.8 days to start laying. Therefore, laying interval was 44 days and the number of clutch per year was 8.2 which was 2-3 times higher than those normally found in general practice. However, commercial laying feed gave significantly more chicks than those supplemented with BRB (66.3 vs. 58.5 heads). But since the first method required higher feed cost, it gained less profit than the second method. Hens in Lampang had higher body weight, higher egg weight and gave more eggs per clutch, thus, produced more chicks and had higher birth weight of chicks than the birds in Chiang Mai. Although hens in Lampang lost more weight during natural incubation and required longer period to resume laying and needed higher feed cost, the income and profit from selling chicks tended to be higher. The results of this experiment indicated that hens soaked in water produced 2-3 times more chicks than the conventional management. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Plant products search: rice ### Animal products search: poultry meat;eggs ### Programs found: project farmer (PF) ### Measurements for interventions: clutch ### Topics keywords: dairy cow;DM;significant difference;economic benefit;beef cattle;body weight ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2005,,"Proceedings of 43rd Kasetsart University Annual Conference, Thailand, 1-4 February, 2005.

"The rearing system of Black Bengal Goat and their farmers in West Bengal, India","","Abstract: Bengal Goat is a precious germplasm of West Bengal. Mostly the women (91.3%) of the farming families in West Bengal rear goat. Goat rearing is a subsidiary income source to rural poor along with agriculture. In majority of cases the flock size ranges from 1 to 4 (56%). Male female ratio in adult flock is observed as 1:8 in field condition. The animals are mostly housed along with residential housing (67.1%); houses are mostly kachha type (82.63%) with earthen floor (86.47%) and straw roof (91.33%). All most all the farmers used to graze their goats for feeding. Ponds water is the major source for drinking water (58.14%) of goats.

THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PRESENT AGRICULTURAL GEOGRAPHY IN NIGERIA: A CASE STUDY OF ONDO AND SOKOTO STATES,"","Abstract: Agriculture has been on the decline in Nigeria since the mid-1970s, reflected by the rapid disappearance of the export commodities and the increased importation of some of these commodities along with foodstuffs that can be produced domestically. This study refutes the often cited repercussions of colonialism, westernization, and/or unfavorable climatic conditions (especially drought), and makes a critical cause and effect analysis of the underlying economic, social, and political institutions under which the agricultural activities suffered which led to the present state of affairs. Of vital importance is the deleterious role the mismanaged oil economy played in weakening the agricultural sector instead of strenghtening it. Primary data for analysis of these social, economic and political parameters were obtained from three sources: (1) comprehensive interviews with 628 local farmers in two physically and culturally different, but quite representative state government areas, (2) interviews with prominent government officials at both the federal and state levels and academics directly involved with agriculture in the country, and (3) a rich body of reports and statistics provided by various Nigerian government units. An analysis of the data from the field work reveals that gross mismanagement, political corruption, neglect, and exploitative practices, along with a displacement of priority in development strategy are the major causes of the aborted agricultural economy in the country. The small-holder farmer, the main producer who accounts for over 95 percent of the total agricultural output in Nigeria, is consistently put in a disadvantaged position with his problems being unattended to. Not only were problems of the small-holder ignored, but the government engaged in adopting and promoting development strategies to remove him off of the land. To alleviate the growing hunger crisis, and to arrest rural distress in Nigeria and other countries of the continent in a similar situation, the development strategies of government should focus on the main producer, i.e., small-holder farmer and the rural areas that make a home for these producers. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Topics keywords: winter wheat;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;rural area;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1987,,,,,,,http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/303506268?accountid=9783,,#37201,,"",""

The study of business process and decision support of raw milk blending for a collecting centre in Thailand.,"","Abstract: Milk is a high nutrient food source. Its major composition includes water, fat, protein, sugar, vitamin and minerals. In Thailand, milk consumption has been promoted through school dairy projects. There are dairy farms throughout Thailand, of which most are small-sized farms. This leads to an uneven nutrient composition due to different agricultural practices, feed, and environments. Thus, the factors that affect the nutrient composition in raw milk should be studied. The Royal Thai government should encourage farmers to Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) so that the nutrients in raw milk are compliant with national standards. The collecting centre must inspect the nutrient composition to ensure that it meets specifications before it is delivered to milk plants. In addition, the raw milk price depends on the fat content. The collecting centre collects raw milk from farmers twice a day. The results of a survey show that raw milk collected in the morning and afternoon has different nutrient compositions; raw milk in the morning has less fat than milk in the afternoon. After raw milk is delivered to the collecting centre, it is cooled and kept in a storage tank. Then, it must be delivered to the milk plants on a daily basis. Hence, our objective is to formulate a mathematical model to determine how to blend raw milk collected in the morning and afternoon so that the total cost of raw milk is minimised while the nutrient composition specification is satisfied. Then, the model is solved using a spreadsheet, and a decision support system is proposed so that the quality control supervisor can determine how to blend raw milk daily. Finally, the blending model is compared with manual blending using the actual data for ten days. It shows that the average costs of both methods are the same; however, the percentage of passing on total solid is improved from 50% to 70%. In addition, the decision time is reduced from 15 minutes to one minute. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Animal products search: raw milk ### Programs found: granary area program (GAP);dairy project ### Topics keywords: GAP;raw milk;anaerobic digestion;dairy cow;decision support system;food safety;dairy industry;taking account;moisture content;mathematical model;dairy farm;decision making;flow rate;TS;decision support;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2016,,International Food Research Journal,,,,,,,#36791,,"",""
"The variation of 90Sr and <sup xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">137</sup>Cs in milk, some factors influencing the radionuclide concentration and the effect of remedial actions.","","Abstract: The literature on radioactive fallout is surveyed with special reference to production, distribution and deposition of nuclides and, following soil and plant contamination, absorption and secretion of Sr and Cs in milk. Cs was estimated by y-spectrometry and the Sr-Y equilibrium was determined. Grass was examined in the summers of 1965 and 1966 and exchangeable cations and Sr were estimated in soil samples taken from the same sites. Milk was sampled during March to April 1965, 1966 and 1967. The analytical methods are described, including a rapid method for Sr in milk. Sr level in milk varied greatly. The highest value for a farm was 271 pCi per litre. The highest and lowest average farm figures for the 3 succeeding years were 69 and 29 pCi per litre. Dairy milk contained still less and levels fell during the period under investigation. There was a significant correlation between Sr in land milk and farm and per 1000 litres of milk, and between milk 90Sr and annual precipitation. An equation is derived for estimating the expected levels of milk Sr with farm land, precipitation, yield and exchangeable soil Ca as the variables. Cs level in milk was significantly correlated to annual precipitation and to milk yield per cow. An equation for estimating expected levels is derived. The variation in Cs was greater than that for Sr and, as with Sr, the frequency of farms with very high milk Cs was low. Cs: Sr in milk varied from district to district, but the variation was not statistically significant except during March to April 1967. During summer 1965 and March to April 1966 the ratio based on farm milk was significantly higher than that calculated from dairy milk. It was significantly higher during the grazing season than in winter. Sr, stable Sr and Cs in hay varied considerably from farm to farm. Liming and fertilising had no effect on radionuclide or stable element concentration. Changing of feeding practices did reduce 137Cs but not Sr in milk. Remedial actions to reduce radiation hazards are suggested, both at local and central levels, and include mixture, storage and decontamination as well as changes in farming and feeding practices.-C.

The wholesale produce auction: An alternative marketing strategy for small farms,"","Abstract: Small farmers urgently need alternative marketing strategies if they are to achieve the goals of a more sustainable agriculture. This study was a survey of nine Pennyslvania wholesale produce auctions, all established between 1984 and 1998. The main goals of the auctions were to serve local communities, provide high-quality produce to local consumers and make profits. The results showed that the auctions typically employ an average of 7-10 people per growing season. The five most common commodities sold were cantaloupe, watermelon, tomato, pumpkin and sweet corn. Asparagus and onions were the least sold during a regular growing season. In terms of market share, roadside market operators purchased the largest proportion of produce (40%), followed by farmers (27%), chain food stores (16%), independent grocery stores (11%) and restaurants (6%), making up an average annual gross sale of $3.5 million per auction. The study revealed that the nine Pennsylvania produce auctions were successful in meeting their goals. The reasons for success included private ownership, excellent quality and freshness of produce, good location, local produce recognition, clientele availability and customer-oriented business. The auction managers identified some weaknesses, including inconsistent and poor grading, limited space in the auction facility, produce unavailability and limited volume, lack of cooling facility, price fluctuation and slow service. The study indicated that local wholesale produce auctions are a useful marketing alternative for small farmers in Pennsylvania, by providing marketing outlets and convenient shopping centers for sellers and buyers; by securing a source of fresh and locally grown produce not found in traditional wholesale terminal markets; and by allowing exchange and networking among farmers and buyers. Consequently, the wholesale produce auction can be a useful model for an alternative marketing strategy and can provide considerable benefits to small farm and rural communities. ### Plant products search: tomatoes;wheat;onions;maize;sweet corn;squashes;cantaloupes;watermelons ### Topics keywords: natural resource;local community;drought stress;land degradation;SA;rural community;dairy industry;growing season;rural tourism;protected area;market share;large scale;social capital;sustainable agriculture",2002,,American Journal of Alternative Agriculture,,,,,,,#36960,,"",""

Thoughts on developing small/medium size no-till equipment for conservation agriculture in Asia: Summary of post-publication peer review comments,"","Abstract: Traditional agriculture bases most of its operations or practices on soil tillage, which causes likely occurrence of water and soil erosion and sediment runoff. In order to conserve soil, water and environment, Conservation agriculture (CA) is increasingly adopted to replace traditional tillage agriculture to achieve sustainable and profitable agriculture and subsequently improve the livelihoods of farmers. CA holds great potential for all sizes of farms and agro-ecological systems, but its adoption is most urgently required by smallholder farmers, especially those short of laborers. Small/medium size no-till machines and implements are the key to CA adoption.

Tobiata grass in rotational pasture on small farms and milk production in northeast Para state.,"","Abstract: cv. Tobiata grass was evaluated under a rotational grazing system on a small farm in Para, Brazil, during 1999-2001. Soil fertilization was carried out with 50 kg phosphorus, 50 kg potassium and 50 kg nitrogen fertilizers/ha. The grazing system, with 6 days of grazing and 29 days rest, was simulated using 3 paddocks. The stocking rate was 1 animal unit/ha, using lactating cows. The cost of pasture establishment was R$429/ha. The total forage available was greater than 1600 kg dry matter//ha in all 17 grazing cycles, except for the 10th cycle. There was a significant difference between the rainy and dry seasons for forage dead matter. Between grazing cycles, there were significant differences for total, leaf and stem available forage and for dead material. The leaf available forage was greater than 1400 kg dry matter/ha in all grazing cycles, except for the 13th. There was no significant difference between cycles, seasons or paddocks for crude protein. Crude protein varied from 6.77 to 8.25%. The pasture studied increased milk productivity by 33% in comparison with traditional management of pasture. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: nitrogen fertilizer;forage;phosphorus;fertilizer;pasture ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;dry matter;lactating cow;sweet potato;dry season;agroforestry system;beef cattle;small scale;DM;significant difference;dairy cattle;CP;stocking rate;food insecurity;spatial distribution;crude protein;dairy farm;crop residue;human activity ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2002,,Boletim de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento - Embrapa Amazonia Oriental,,,,,,,#36662,,"",""
Tri-trophic insecticidal effects of African plants against cabbage pests.,"","Abstract: Botanical insecticides are increasingly attracting research attention as they offer novel modes of action that may provide effective control of pests that have already developed resistance to conventional insecticides. They potentially offer cost-effective pest control to smallholder farmers in developing countries if highly active extracts can be prepared simply from readily available plants. Field cage and open field experiments were conducted to evaluate the insecticidal potential of nine common Ghanaian plants: goat weed, (Asteraceae), Siam weed, (Asteraceae), Cinderella weed, (Asteraceae), chili pepper, (Solanaceae), tobacco, (Solanaceae) cassia, (Leguminosae), physic nut, (Euphorbiaceae), castor oil plant, (Euphorbiaceae) and basil, (Lamiaceae). In field cage experiments, simple detergent and water extracts of all botanical treatments gave control of cabbage aphid, and diamondback moth, , equivalent to the synthetic insecticide Attack® (emamectin benzoate) and superior to water or detergent solution. In open field experiments in the major and minor rainy seasons using a sub-set of plant extracts (, , , and ), all controlled and more effectively than water control and comparably with or better than Attack®. Botanical and water control treatments were more benign to third trophic level predators than Attack®. Effects cascaded to the first trophic level with all botanical treatments giving cabbage head weights, comparable to Attack® in the minor season. In the major season, and treatment gave lower head yields than Attack® but the remaining botanicals were equivalent or superior to this synthetic insecticide. Simply-prepared extracts from readily-available Ghanaian plants give beneficial, tri-trophic benefits and merit further research as an inexpensive plant protection strategy for smallholder farmers in West Africa. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana;Benin ### Plant products search: nuts;chili;pepper;chillies;tobacco;basil;chili peppers;leafy vegetables ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;experiment conducted;cropping system;dry matter;developing country;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;BMP;field experiment;flow rate;pest control;significant difference;cost effective;economic benefit;field experiment conducted;plant height;growing season;FYM;smallholder farmer;DAS;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2013,,PLoS ONE,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0078651,,#36796,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-08 05:58:47)(Screen): No water component.; ,Experimental
"Uncertainty and developmental risk in ""Pequeña Irrigación"" decisions for peasants in Campeche, Mexico.","","Abstract: The paper presents an approach for evaluating resource development possibilities by structuring policy alternatives in their regional context. To provide the structure for evaluating irrigation project alternatives for Mexican peasants, a product set A X B X C X D containing the most important uncertainty considerations is defined with the following elements: [a = general agriculture, a = agglomerated agriculture], [b = small scale, b2 = large scale], [c = low performance, c high performance], and [d = labour intensive, d = mechanized]. Thus, four levels of uncertainty and eight uncertainty characteristics surround the 2 alternatives admitted. The structure shows certain systematic properties when arranged in a tree diagram. Description of ' developmental risk' (penalty to the peasant for selecting less than ' best' alternative), programming a sequence of alternatives to satisfy objectives of diffusing technology, and building a viable regional economy through agglomeration are expedited by such a structure, which is intended as a predesign, programming tool.

"Undernutrition and poverty: magnitude, pattern, and measures for alleviation.","","Abstract: The number of undernourished in developing countries, excluding China, is estimated to range between 450-700 million, with numbers varying depending upon assumptions regarding (a) the extent to which individuals adapt to a decline in calorie intake without adverse effects on health, and (b) the levels of physical activity. However, this estimate does not take into account the impact of an inadequate health and sanitary environment on undernutrition. Access to food and hygiene are twin pillars on which progress in the elimination or reduction of undernutrition depends. Assurance of access to food on the part of the hungry and undernourished requires measures to expand their food entitlement through the expansion of employment and income, and to ensure adequate and stable food supplies. Hunger and undernutrition at the household level are also dependent on such factors as who in the family earns an income and controls food expenditure. The hard core of the poor and the undernourished in many countries consists of the rural landless labour, small farmers, farmers in arid or infertile regions, and the urban unemployed. Direct attacks on poverty and undernutrition are needed, especially in the short run, to strengthen the poverty reducing impact of employment oriented growth. These include food subsidies, and labour intensive public work projects. International food or financial aid can also be used and policy reforms can be instigated which eliminate discrimination against the poor and the rural and agricultural sectors where the majority of the poor live. ### Countries mentioned: China;Hungary ### Programs found: work project;labour intensive public work (PW) project;public work (PW) project ### Topics keywords: short term;developing country;adverse effect;take account;short run;human health;point view;taking account;factor influencing;taken account ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",1989,,1988 World Food Conference proceedings.

Understanding production potentials and yield gaps in intensive maize production in China,"","Abstract: Understanding yield potentials and exploitable gaps in current intensive maize (Zea mays L.) production is essential in order to increase grain yields to meet future food requirements amid strong competition for limited resources. In this study, we used simulations with the Hybrid-Maize Model (http://www.hybridmaize.unl.edu/), highest recorded yields published in the literature, field experiments, and farm survey data to assess yield potentials and gaps in four maize agro-ecological regions of China. In 50 simulations of high-yield sites across China from 1990 to 2009, the yield potential averaged 16.5Mgha-1 for irrigated maize and 13.9Mgha-1 for rainfed maize, respectively. During the same period, the highest recorded yield was 15.4Mgha-1, or 93% of the yield potential of irrigated maize. In comparison, the average farmer's yield was 7.9Mgha-1 based on 5584 farms surveyed in 2007-2008. Consequently, the yield gap between the average farmer's yield and the modeled yield potential (YGM) was 8.6Mgha-1 for irrigated maize and 6.0Mgha-1 for rainfed maize and so farmers attained 48-56% of the yield potential. The yield gap between the average farmer's yield and highest recorded yield (YGR) was 7.6Mgha-1, so farmers attained 51% of the recorded yield. Because the sites used for simulated and recorded yields possessed the most favorable combinations of soil and crop management, closing the gaps in YGM and YGR in farmers' fields within a short time frame could be very difficult. The attainable yield was collected from field experiments, which were conducted in farmers' fields by farmers using recommended management practices by local agronomists. The data for attainable yield averaged 12.3Mgha-1 according 137 field experiments across China. The yield gap between the average farmer's yield and the experimental yield (YGE) was 4.5Mgha-1, with farmers attaining 64% of the experimental yield. The main factor explaining this gap was inefficient crop management practices, which constrained yield improvements in farmers' fields. In order to narrow this gap, multidisciplinary understanding and cooperation among the disciplines of plant science, agronomy, soil science, agro-ecology and extension, resulting in integrated soil-crop system management, are essential. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: maize ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;experiment conducted;cropping system;dry matter;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;flow rate;grain yield;significant difference;yield gap;field experiment conducted;zea may L;management practice;plant height;growing season;FYM;DAS;field experiment ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2013,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2012.09.023,,#37549,,"",""
Understanding the adoption of system technologies in smallholder agriculture: The system of rice intensification (SRI) in Timor Leste [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Against the background of rising food demand, decreasing productivity growth, and environmental degradation, natural resource management technologies, such as the system of rice intensification (SRI), have been propagated, especially in a smallholder farm context. However, system technologies are often location specific and characterized by partial adoption and disadoption. Previous studies were often not able to fully explain this, because they mostly relied on farm and household level data, neglecting plot level differences that may be important. We address this limitation, using SRI adoption in Timor Leste as an example. Regression models are specified and estimated to explain the farmers’ decision-making processes. Participation in training programs and household labor availability increase the probability and intensity of adoption, as SRI is knowledge and labor intensive. However, many other household variables are not significant, while plot level characteristics, such as proximity to the homestead, water control capacity, slope, and soil conditions, have more explanatory power. The results suggest that plot level data are important to understand the adoption of system technologies. Moreover, technology adaptation to different plot conditions seems to be a precondition for widespread diffusion. ### Countries mentioned: Timor-Leste ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: education program;training program;educational program ### Topics keywords: natural resource;natural resource management;decision making process;special issue;decision making ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,Agricultural systems,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44796487&site=ehost-live,,#37582,,"",""
World food supply and world agriculture: experiences of the last 50 years.,"","Abstract: This report examines the socio-economic effects of agricultural modernization, food security and nutrition, agricultural production and productivity in developing countries, the significance of economic policy for poverty reduction and food security, and lessons learnt from the last 50 years. Progress in hunger reduction has been insufficient and it remains a major challenge. Access to food is a greater problem than insufficiency of supply. Economic growth has not necessarily been paralleled by reductions in poverty and hunger; farmers lacking resources have been unable to compete in the face of modern agriculture, and access to land, water, credit, information, and markets is unequal. The key role of agriculture has in many cases been overlooked by politicians in the drive to industrialize their countries. Technical capital inputs have led to unprecedented rises in crop yields. However, there have also been negative consequences such as deforestation and the loss of productive land to urbanization. The benefits of, for example, the Green Revolution have been unevenly distributed. Human capital has an equally important role to play, together with the maintenance of healthy and stable institutions. Farmers must have adequate incentives if they are to achieve full production potential. Globalization presents both opportunities and risks. ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;arable land;developing country;sustainable development;chemical fertilizer;green revolution;rural household;agricultural machinery;human capital;pest control;poverty reduction;social capital;modern agriculture;sustainable agriculture;food security",2002,,"Schriftenreihe des Bundesministeriums für Verbraucherschutz, Ernährung und Landwirtschaft, Reihe A, Angewandte Wissenschaft",,,,,,,#37431,,"",Observational
West Africa: new realities and/or new paradigms?,"","Abstract: The article presents points for discussion concerning the current situation and problems in West Africa, highlighting the main elements of change and major characteristics which will condition future international aid and intervention. It first describes the countries of West Africa in terms of population, economy, society and resources. Although agriculture should be the main source of development, the erosion of the ecosystem and extensive water pollution have become a serious hindrance to this. Land shortage has resulted in agricultural intensification to try to meet food demand, but this has been at the expense of subsistence farming. The best option for peasant farmers is often to migrate to urban areas, which are now becoming recognized as essential for socioeconomic development and alternative economic activities. Information is also presented on: political and social conflict, markets and deficits, population control policy, ""trickle down"" and ""trickle up"" development, and the role of women in development. ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;land use change;current situation;arable land;sustainable development;water saving;dairy industry;specie richness;agricultural machinery;economic benefit;agricultural intensification;beef cattle;rural area;raw material",1995,,Bulletin d'Information du Centre Sahel,,,,,,,#37418,,"",Observational
X-ray fluorescence detected variation in nutraceutic-implied mineral density in underutilized plants mapped as women-operated smallholder units in the Lake Victoria basin.,"","Abstract: Indigenous plant biodiversity plays a key role in providing nutritional and medicinal (nutraceutical) need for smallholder farming communities. The objective of this paper was to relate farming decisions, farm landscape morphology, crop species placement points, and the nutraceutical-implied micronutrient mineral (NIMM) density. The Kisumu (Kenya), Iganga (Uganda) and Bukoba (Tanzania) lake basins were the three eco-regional environs studied and were treated as the primary hierarchical level. Two visited sites (secondary level) for reconnaissance/collection were nested within the primary level. Fifteen dominantly female households were further nested within sites (tertiary level). By means of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, indigenous variant plants (accessions) encountered were collected for density. XRF analyses were backed by key informant interviews. Empirically, indigenous/traditional plant species and, by extension, their diversity in NIMM density, was a three-factor dependent variable in terms of: (a) the ethnobotanic-based farming decisions by which the NIMM indigenous/underutilized plant bio-resources encountered were purposively grown; (b) choices that were dictated by the topographic soil surface characteristics (terrain upland, steep and valley land properties); ### Countries mentioned: Uganda;Kenya;Tanzania ### Topics keywords: dependent variable;soil fertility;smallholder farming;smallholder farmer;farming system;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",2009,,Acta Horticulturae,,,,,,,#37351,,"",Observational

Why financial incentives can destroy economically valuable biodiversity in Ethiopia.,"","Abstract: Ethiopian montane rainforests are economically valuable repositories of biodiversity, especially of wild populations, and they are vanishing at accelerating rates. Our research results confirm theory which explains biodiversity loss by diverging private and social net benefits from land conversion. Poor farmers basically live from hand-to-mouth and manage resources with very short term planning horizons. In such circumstances they cannot afford to carry the cost burden of conservation from which the broader national and global society benefits. Society, on the other hand, highly values the biodiversity of Ethiopia's montane rainforests, but has not managed to put mechanisms in place which enable to pay for the conservation of these values and conservation policies are in place but are not implemented. While it is economically rational for the farmer to convert forests into agricultural land and thereby improve his income (the financial incentive we refer to here), it is economically irrational for national and global society not to pay for conservation. The core reasons for such divergence is that institutions for conservation and sustainable use are not in place. We identify the most important ones and recommend changes for the Ethiopian case. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: short term;economic benefit;net return ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2007,,ZEF-Discussion Papers on Development Policy,,,,,,,#37292,,"",Observational
Weed management perspectives for India in the changing agriculture scenario in the country.,"","Abstract: India is the fourth largest economy in the world. Agriculture continues to be the most important sector of Indian economy providing employment and livelihood to nearly 70% of the total population. It has done well all through to feed the growing population. About 2.5 mt of additional food grains are required annually in the next 10 years to meet the demand of the growing population. This is a huge challenge as it has to come from shrinking (both in quality and quantity) land and water resources, adverse climatic and market forces, poor infrastructure, etc. The government is putting lot of thrust on agriculture in its 11th five year plan (2007-12), recognizing that agriculture growth is key to achieve the target of 9.0% growth in total GDP. The government is responding to these challenges by increasing the investment, launching several developmental schemes and providing policy support. Many of the schemes are pro-poor and pro-small holders aimed at achieving inclusive growth. One such scheme, the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme which guarantees employment/wages to one adult in a household for 100 days in a year, has benefited millions of rural workforce. However, this has also made the labor expensive and unavailable for agricultural operations including weeding. The paper discusses the challenges and opportunities of weed management in the light of changing agricultural scenario in the country. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Topics keywords: small scale;GDP;factor influencing;dairy cattle;gross domestic product ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2011,,"23rd Asian-Pacific Weed Science Society Conference.

"Weather, herbage quality and milk production in pastoral systems. 4. Effects on dairy cattle production.","","Abstract: Prevailing weather conditions are one factor that influences herbage growth and quality, and therefore may have a substantial impact on animal production. The objective of the present study was to quantify the associations between weather, herbage quality and mineral concentration, and animal production. Daily weather data and weekly records of herbage quality and mineral concentration, as well as dairy cattle production, were available from a research farm and nearby weather station across the years 1995 to 2001, inclusive. Animal production variables of interest included individual cow milk production and composition, body condition score, and liveweight, as well as group herbage dry matter intake. Results: indicate moderate relationships between some weather- and herbage-related variables and dairy cattle production variables, although most relationships appeared to be an artefact of temporal variation, as evidenced by weakening of correlations following adjustment for animal parity, stage of lactation, and week of the year at calving. Prior to adjustment for the confounding factors, the negative associations between milk yield and all temperature-related variables (=-0.46 to -0.34) were most notable. Following adjustment for time of year, milk yield became positively associated with sunlight hours (=0.14). Negative relationships were demonstrated between temperature-related variables and milk protein concentration (=-0.08), regardless of time of year. Milk protein concentration was positively associated with herbage metabolisable energy content (=0.06), water-soluble carbohydrate (=0.11), and organic matter digestibility (=0.06) concentrations, and negatively associated with ether extract (=-0.07), acid detergent fibre (=-0.06), and neutral detergent fibre (=-0.05) concentrations. Weather, herbage quality and mineral concentration explained up to 22% more variation in dairy cattle production variables over and above farmlet and time of year, with a greater effect on dry matter intake than the other production parameters. ### Animal products search: cow milk ### Measurements for interventions: milk yield ### Topics keywords: DM;OM;growing season;weather condition;dry matter;dairy cattle;organic matter",2009,,Animal Production Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1071/EA07310,,#36932,,"",""
Wood density: A tool to find complementary species for the design of mixed species plantations,"","Abstract: The successful establishment and growth of mixed-species forest plantations requires that complementary or facilitatory species be identified. This can be difficult in many tropical areas because the growth characteristics of endemic species are often unknown, particularly when grown at potentially higher densities in plantations than in natural forests. Here, we investigate whether wood density is a useful and readily accessible trait for choosing complementary species for mixed species plantations. Wood density represents the carbon investment per unit volume of stem with a trade-off generally found between fast (low wood density) and slow (high wood density) growing species. To do this, we use data collected from 18 highly diverse mixed species plantations (4-23 mostly native species) aged from 6 to 11. years at the time of data collection located on Leyte Island, Philippines. We found significant negative correlations between wood densities and the height of the most abundant species, as well as with measures of overall stand growth and tree diameter size distribution.Not only do species with denser woods have slower growth rates, but also mixed-species plantations with higher average wood density and higher stem density were also less productive, at least in these young plantations. Similarly, stands with a high diversity in wood densities were less productive. There is growing interest in making greater use of native multi-species mixtures in smallholder and community planting programs in the tropics, and our results show databases of wood density values may help improve their design. In the early development stages of plantations, canopy closure and rapid height growth are usually key silvicultural targets, and wood density values can predict the rapid height development of species. If plantations are being grown for the livelihood of small landholders then the best target is to choose some species with different wood densities. This allows an early harvest of low-wood density species for early income, and will also reduce competition for slower growing trees with higher wood densities for later income generation. ### Countries mentioned: Philippines ### Programs found: community planting program;planting program ### Topics keywords: small scale;NF;specie richness;RO ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2014,,Forest Ecology and Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.08.022,,#36843,,"",""

Welfare problems in dairy calves.,"","Abstract: The most significant welfare problems in dairy calves in intensive rearing conditions have been investigated in this paper. These problems mainly result from inadequate intake of colostrum (separation from the dam), inadequate ventilation (resulting in inappropriate airflow, low or high temperatures, high humidity and poor air quality), poor floor conditions (wet floor, without bedding), inadequate monitoring of health, exposure to pathogens causing respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders and occurrence of iron deficiency. In addition, on cattle farms in our country welfare problems in calves originate from continuous restocking (no ""all in - all out"") and mixing calves from different sources, as well as insufficiently balanced solid food, insufficient access to water and generally poor response of farmer to health problems, especially necessary dietary changes. A special welfare problem is insufficient floor space allowance which results in calf's discomfort. ### Animal products search: colostrum ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;factor affecting;CI",2011,,Biotechnology in Animal Husbandry,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2298/BAH1104417H,,#36699,,"",""

"Weather and peasantry of Upper Brittany, 1780-1789.","","Abstract: Historians of Old Regime France have long been aware of some of the relationships between meteorological change and peasant communities. The disastrous harvests and famines of the 17th century and the effects of the poor harvest of 1788 on the insurrections of the following year have all been thoroughly studied. From these a model of weather conditions and rural societies has developed. Thus a poor harvest is generally held to produce greater death rates, migration, indebtedness, unemployment, sales of peasant property and falling wage rates. Yet the model may only hold good for the effects of spectacular weather conditions. Thus in the region around the town of Vitre in Britanny in the 1780s, peasants were able to withstand the droughts of 1782, 1785-86 and poor harvest of 1788 surprisingly well. The major victims were infants and children who could be replaced easily, while the poor may have held their own because secondary sources of income were only partially dependent upon the grain harvest. Other signs of a crisis in rural society are missing. The well-off peasantry actually benefited from a poor harvest. Employment for farmhands and wages remained more or less steady. The local economy was able to support the same number of households despite poor harvests, indebtedness did not increase and peasants were not forced to sell land to supposedly rapacious urban dwellers.-from Author ### Countries mentioned: France ### Plant products search: grain ### Topics keywords: winter wheat;weather condition;growing season;factor affecting ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1981,,Climate and history,,,,,,,#36608,,"Nicola Randall (2019-06-06 19:33:55)(Screen): no, modelling based on 1700s; ",""
Watershed services payments to smallholders in the Brazilian Amazon: Challenges and perspectives [Pagamento por servios hdricos a agricultores familiares na Amaznia oriental: Desafios e perspectivas],"","Abstract: Several hydrobiogeochemical research activities have been conducted in the Eastern Amazon, contributing to the understanding of how changes in forests and agro-ecosystems affect the provision of services to ecosystems. The findings have demonstrated that good agricultural practices and the presence of natural secondary vegetation favored by the management of small family farms are important factors for hydrobiogeochemical cycling, aquatic ecosystem conservation, soil conservation, and mitigation of trace gases emissions from biomass burning in Amazonian small catchments. Two challenges for watershed service management arise in this context. First, low population densities and the relatively flat landscape mean that a critical mass of downstream beneficiaries of such services - a prerequisite for public intervention is more difficult to identify than in more densely populated mountainous areas. Second, although watershed service providers (farmers) are also to a considerable extent service beneficiaries, conflicts over land and cultural heterogeneities among settlers inhibit local collective action to safeguard the quality of stream water. Including small landholders in carbon payment schemes that compensate for the maintenance of riverbank vegetation would appear to be a cost-effective means to secure watershed services as additional benefits of forest-based mitigation of climate change. ### Topics keywords: aquatic ecosystem;biological control;agro ecosystem;collective action;point view;BMP;sustainable agriculture;pest control;long term;GAP;food safety;population density;protected area;cost effective;economic benefit;social capital;management practice;ecosystem service;cover crop;climate change;spatial distribution;human activity;CC",2013,,Revista Ambiente e Agua,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4136/ambi-agua.1056,,#36517,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-06 05:20:40)(Screen): No counterfactual.; ,Observational
"Willingness to pay for water and water rights definition: Study among smallholder irrigators in Limpopo province, South Africa","","Abstract: Internationally there is growing understanding that water rights are important and that a lack of effective water rights systems creates major problems for the management of increasingly scarce water supplies. In South Africa the smallholder irrigation sector faces two major challenges. Firstly water use is inefficient and secondly government, which in the past invested huge amounts of money in the sector, targets improved cost recovery. Improving the definition of the water rights system can have a positive effect with regard to these challenges. At one hand improvements in the definition of water rights can stimulate smallholders to use water more productively, encouraging cooperation and investment; at the other hand an improved water rights system increases willingness to pay for water, allowing government to charge higher water prices and thus improve cost recovery. This study proposes contingent ranking to analyse the willingness to pay of smallholder irrigators for changes in the water rights system. Results indicate that smallholders are prepared to pay considerably higher water prices if these prices are connected with advancements in the water rights system. In a second step the sample population was stratified to evaluate the impact of smallholder characteristics on their willingness to pay. The importance attached to different dimensions of water rights clearly differs among groups. For example farmers suffering water shortages attach more importance to secure water supply. Policy makers can use such results to guide reforms in the design of water rights and to increase public support for interventions. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: natural resource;drought stress;water saving;water shortage;SA;willingness pay;decision making;WTP;contract farming;policy maker ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2009,,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2495/WRM090311,,#36501,,"",""
"Wheat improvement in India: Present status, emerging challenges and future prospects","","Abstract: India is the second largest producer of wheat in the world, with production hovering around 68-75 million tons for past few years. The latest estimated demand for wheat production for the year 2020 is approximately 87.5 million tons, or about 13 million tons more than the record production of 75 million tons harvested in crop season 1999-2000. Since 2000, India has struggled to match that record production figure and thus faces a critical challenge in maintaining food security in the face of its growing population. The current major challenges facing future wheat production in India are increasing heat stress; dwindling water supplies for irrigation; a growing threat of new virulence of diseases such as wheat rusts (yellow, brown, and black) and leaf blight; continuous adoption of rice-wheat systems on around 11 million hectares; changes in urbanization patterns, and demand for better quality wheat. In addition, the threat posed by the new stem rust race Ug99 can not be underestimated. The wide gap (around 2.5 t/ha) between the potential and harvested yield in the eastern Gangetic Plains also cries out for solutions. Addressing issues related to different stresses will require harnessing genes discovered in landraces and wild relatives following conventional as well as non-conventional approaches. For effective technology delivery in areas that suffer from poor linkages with farmers, participatory research needs to be strengthened. The future germplasm requirements from a dependable collaborator such as CIMMYT are largely being dictated by the above factors. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: rice;wheat ### Measurements for crops: wheat ### Topics keywords: future prospect;million hectare;arable land;dairy cow;agricultural machinery;heat stress;food security ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2007,,Euphytica,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10681-007-9385-7,,#36474,,"",""
What impact are EU supermarket standards having on developing countries' export of high-value horticultural products? Evidence from Kenya,"","Abstract: European Union retailers are setting global benchmarks for the production of fresh food and are asking their suppliers for produce to be certified according to food safety and quality standards. Compliance with these standards for developing countries' small-scale producers entails costly investment in variable inputs and longterm structures. Limited empirical evidence exists either to refute or confirm the concern that the proliferation and enhanced stringency of these standards marginalize smallholders from the global market. This paper therefore explores the costs of compliance, factors explaining the smallholder decision to adopt EU private quality standards, and the impacts of the standards on farm financial performance. We develop a 2-stage standard treatment effect model to account for self-selection as a source of endogeneity. Analysis is based on a random cross section sample of 439 small-scale export vegetable producers in Kenya whose production was monitored in 2005-2006. We demonstrate that adopters and nonadopters are distinguishable by their asset holding and household wealth, access to services, labor endowment, and level of education. Once we control for the endogeneity problem, we find that small-scale producers can benefit substantially from adopting the standards at the farm level. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: vegetables ### Topics keywords: small scale;developing country;food safety;EU;small scale producer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2010,,Journal of International Food and Agribusiness Marketing,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/08974431003641398,,#36351,,"",""
Water management at Kraseio Irrigation Project. Analysis of historical data.,"","Abstract: The Royal Irrigation Department and the Overseas Development Unit at Hydraulics Research, Wallingford are undertaking collaborative research at the Kraseio Irrigation Project, Thailand. The objective of the research is to develop and test a systematic approach to improving main system water management in existing small holder rice irrigation schemes through the introduction of a microcomputer based water scheduling and information system. This report describes the historical analysis which was undertaken prior to the introduction of computer-assisted water scheduling. The purpose of the work was to provide baseline data by which subsequent performance of the system could be judged, to identify elements of existing practice for incorporation into the new operational system and to derive parameters to assist in setting up and calibrating the computer models. Hydrological analysis produced values for rainfall and reservoir inflows at different probability levels for use in the models. Overall water use rates for eight seasons from 1984 to 1987 were calculated and compared with rainfall and irrigated areas. Releases for land preparation were deduced and the volume of water abstracted by users upstream of the scheme was quantified. The distribution of supply throughout the main system was calculated and compared for three seasons in 1987 and 1988. Modifications were made to algorithms included in the water scheduling model WATREQ after trial runs with historic data to compare the output with actual releases. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Thailand ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: irrigation project;kraseio irrigation project;rice irrigation project ### Topics keywords: small scale;irrigation scheme;food insecurity;water saving ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1989,,Report - Hydraulics Research Limited,,,,,,,#36347,,Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-07 06:14:49)(Screen): doesn't talk about the intervention; only discusses baseline data; ,""
"Yield, water productivity and economic return of dryland wheat in the Loess Plateau in response to conservation tillage practices.","","Abstract: Winter wheat ( L.) production on the Loess Plateau in China has been threatened by water scarcity and climate change during the last decade. Sustainable crop production in this region requires managerial practices that can provide high yield and high water productivity (WP). A 7-year (2001-2008) study at the Loess Plateau Research Station of Lanzhou University investigated the effects of various conservation tillage practices on grain yield, soil water content (SWC), WP and economic return of winter wheat production. Tillage treatments included: conventional tillage (T), conventional tillage followed by stubble retention (TS), no-till (NT) and no-till followed by stubble retention (NTS). Over the entire experimental period, grain yield and WP of winter wheat ranged from 1279 to 4894 kg/ha and 0.32 to 2.41 kg/m, respectively. Both were significantly affected by tillage treatment and year, while SWC was only affected by year. Grain yield and WP in TS was increased by 4.9, 12.1, 0.9% and 13.7, 20.4 and 3.9% compared with NTS, NT and T, respectively, over seven growing seasons. Additionally, a multiple linear regression analysis indicated that grain yield is mainly limited by SWC during planting. Despite its lower grain yield, the NTS treatment increased economic benefit by US$ 328, US$ 23 and US$ 87/ha compared with TS, NT and T, respectively. Therefore, it is suggested that increasing soil water storage at wheat sowing time and encouraging the use of NTS could improve economic returns in this region. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Plant products search: winter wheat;grain;wheat ### Programs found: watershed program (WP) ### Measurements for crops: winter wheat;grain;wheat ### Topics keywords: last decade;CA;water saving;TS;factor affecting;tillage practice;regression analysis;winter wheat;point view;conventional tillage;large scale;traceability system;NT;anaerobic digestion;crop rotation;conservation tillage;CT;water scarcity;economic benefit;cover crop;climate change;supply chain;growing season;crop residue;human activity;CC;grain yield ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2017,,Journal of Agricultural Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/S0021859617000338,,#36330,,"Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-06 07:59:07)(Screen): even though the study was conducted in a region that definitely has smallholders, it does not mention it explicitly in the abstract, hence excluded.; Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-06 04:53:13)(Screen): short discussion on Slack in the inclusion/exclusion channel; Ellen McCullough (2019-06-06 04:36:46)(Screen): I thought we should include because this addresses a staple crop in western China, a region with lots of smallholder farmers.

"Why keep lions instead of livestock? Assessing wildlife tourism-based payment for ecosystem services involving herders in the Maasai Mara, Kenya.","","Abstract: This paper examines the effects of wildlife tourism-based payments for ecosystem services (PES) on poverty, wealth inequality and the livelihoods of herders in the Maasai Mara Ecosystem in south-western Kenya. It uses the case of Olare Orok Conservancy PES programme in which pastoral landowners have agreed to voluntary resettlement and exclusion of livestock grazing from their sub-divided lands. These lands are set aside for wildlife tourism, in return for direct monetary payments by a coalition of five commercial tourism operators. Results show that, on the positive side, PES is the most equitable income source that promotes income diversification and buffers households from the livestock income declines during periods of severe drought, such as in 2008-2009. Without accounting for the opportunity costs, the magnitude of the PES cash transfer to households is, on average, sufficient to close the poverty gap. The co-benefits of PES implementation include the creation of employment opportunities in the conservancy and provision of social services. There is however a need to mitigate the negative effects of PES, including the widening inequality in income between PES and non-PES households and the leakages resulting from the displacement of settlements and livestock to currently un-subdivided pastoral commons. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Programs found: effect payment ecosystem service (PES) program;benefit payment environmental service (PES) program;payment ecosystem service (PES) program;olare orok conservancy payment environmental service (PES) program;payment environmental service (PES) program;payment environmental service program (PESP) ### Topics keywords: short term;ecosystem service;human health;point view;employment opportunity;negative effect;factor influencing;factor affecting;human activity;rural area ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2013,,Natural Resources Forum,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-8947.12027,,#36302,,"",""
"WATER, SOIL AND SOCIOMETABOLIC FRACTURE OF AGRIBUSINESS. Fruit activity in Petorca, Chile","","Abstract: We inquire the socio-ecological transformations that the agribusiness generates in the territorial dynamics through the concept of social metabolism. The study consists in; a) the method of estimation of virtual water, for the calculation of water volumes used in the fruit sector and its impacts on water availability in the basins, b) analysis of the territorial transformation of the social relations on the use of land and the different kinds of crops. We take as a case study the Petorca Province in Chile, a place that had experienced an intense territorial conflict regarding the water issue, caused by the private water management in Chile, fruit agribusiness and the effects of long periods of droughts. The results show the deepening of a socio-metabolic rift on the territory, generated by the intensification of fruit exportation. This rift made peasant agriculture unviable by provoking territorial dynamics where small farmers do not have water to raise animals and to plant crops for their subsistence. ### Countries mentioned: Chile ### Plant products search: fruits ### Topics keywords: water saving;point view;human activity ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2018,,BITACORA URBANO TERRITORIAL,,,,,https://doi.org/10.15446/bitacora.v28n3.72210,,#36300,,"",""
Weed management in upland rice in sub-Saharan Africa: Impact on labor and crop productivity,"","Abstract: Rice is one of the most important crops for food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There exists, however, a widening gap between its regional demand and supply. Competition from weeds is typically one of the major biophysical constraints in upland rice, frequently leading to significant yield losses and sometimes to complete crop failure, thereby threatening the food security of subsistence farmers. However, weed management practices that are currently employed to avoid such losses are associated with high weeding labor demands. This study examined the relationships between weeding times per farm, average time per hectare per weeding and rice yields of upland rice farmers in SSA, with the objective of estimating the impact of weeds on rural households' economies in SSA reliant on upland rice production systems. To this end, we analyzed survey data collected from 992 farmers in four countries (Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Togo and Uganda). The counterfactual outcomes framework of modern evaluation theory was used to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the number of times a farm is weeded on weeding labor efficiency, as measured by the average number of hours spent per hectare at each weeding, and on crop productivity expressed as rice grain yield per hectare. A single weeding required 173 h per hectare, while weeding twice required 130 h per hectare per weeding (259 h per hectare in total) and weeding three times required 125 h per hectare per weeding (376 h per hectare in total). Correspondingly, a single weeding was associated with an average rice yield of 1.2 t ha-1, weeding twice yielded 1.7 t ha-1 and weeding three times yielded 2.2 t ha-1. Compared to the situation where the farm is weeded only once and controlling for other factors, the model estimated yield gains of a second weeding to be 0.33 t ha-1 and a third weeding to result in a gain of 0.51 t ha-1. The estimated labor gains were respectively 64.2 and 68.1 h per hectare per weeding for a second and a third weeding. We conclude that weeding an upland rice crop more than once in SSA increases weeding labor efficiency by about 37 % and rice productivity by more than 27 %. Rather than motivating farmers to increase their labor inputs for manual weeding, however, we propose that more research and development funds should be devoted to developing, testing and promoting locally adapted strategies of labor-saving weed management in rice in sub-Saharan Africa. This will result in a significant contribution to regional food security and poverty alleviation. ### Countries mentioned: Uganda;Togo;Cameroon;Congo;Congo ### Plant products search: grain;rice ### Measurements for interventions: weeding ### Topics keywords: small scale;poverty alleviation;SSA;rural household;rural development;management practice;smallholder farmer;weed management practice;DAS;grain yield;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",2014,,Food Security,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-014-0351-7,,#36274,,"",""
Water use indicators at farm scale: methodology and case study.,"","Abstract: Indicators for water use at farm scale can assist farmers in understanding the water flows on their farms and in optimizing water use by adapting agronomic measures and farm management. The objective of this work is to develop a methodology to estimate water flows at the farm scale, to derive indicators for farm water use, and to apply them in a first case study. After the spatial and temporal boundaries of the farm system and the water flows are defined, three indicators to assess water use at the farm scale are developed: farm water productivity, degree of water utilization, and specific inflow of technical water. Farm water productivity describes the ratio of farm output to water input, where the water input is the total of those water inflows into the farm system that can be assigned to the generation of farm output. Farm output is expressed on a mass basis, food energy basis, and monetary basis. The degree of water utilization characterizes the relationship between productive water to the total water inflow into the farm system, where productive water comprises those water flows that directly contribute to biomass generation via plant and animal metabolism. The specific technical water inflow quantifies the water inflow into the system by technical means relative to the farm area. The application of the methodology in a first case study for a mixed crop-livestock farm with 2869 ha in Germany results in a farm water productivity of 2.30 kg fresh mass per m, 1.03 kg dry mass per m, 5.96 GJ m, and 0.25 Euro m. The degree of water utilization is 0.56. The specific technical water inflow is 36.5 m ha year. Factors that mainly effect these indicators and general approaches to optimize water use in farms are discussed as well as the further research required for practical implementation. ### Countries mentioned: Germany ### Topics keywords: DM;energy consumption;plant height ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2012,,Food and Energy Security,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/fes3.6,,#36263,,"",""
Whole wheat grain feeding of Merino ewes. 3. Influence of level of wheat and vitamin A on wool growth in pregnancy and lactation.,"","Abstract: 3. The effects of wheat and vitamin A on wool growth in pregnancy and lactation in the same trials are reported. In both trials weight of clean wool and staple length increased linearly with increase in wheat intake. In the first trial fibre diameter increased linearly with increase in wheat intake, but the relation was curvilinear in the second. Values for weight of clean wool were greater in wheat/paddock groups than in wheat/pen groups. Vitamin A did not affect wool traits, apart from a lower scouring yield in ewes given vitamin A in the second trial. In the first, during late pregnancy and lactation, there was a reduction in rate of wool growth by 40% in wheat groups and 44% in pasture groups. In the second trial there was a reduction in rate of wool growth in wheat groups, compared with that in early pregnancy, of 11% in late pregnancy and 33% in lactation. Decline during lactation was proportionally greater at lower wheat intakes in both trials. ### Plant products search: grain;wheat ### Measurements for crops: wheat ### Topics keywords: DM;factor influencing;dairy cow",1976,,Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture and Animal Husbandry,,,,,,,#36233,,"",""
Valuing Improvements in The Water Rights System in South Africa: A Contingent Ranking Approach,"","Abstract: In the context of increasing water scarcity, understanding is growing that irrigation water rights are important and that a lack of an effective water rights system constitutes a major reason for inefficient water management. This study carried out a contingent ranking experiment to study how smallholder irrigators in South Africa would value potential changes in water rights. Three specific dimensions of water rights, relevant for the South African case, are considered: duration, quality of title, and transferability. Results indicate that smallholder irrigators are prepared to pay considerably higher water prices if improvements are made in the water rights system. This implies that the proposed interventions in the water rights system would improve the efficiency and productivity of the small-scale irrigation sector. The increased willingness to pay could furthermore also assist the South African government to reach the objective of increased cost recovery. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: small scale;drought stress;water saving;SA;willingness pay;water scarcity;WTP ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2010,,Journal of the American Water Resources Association,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00480.x,,#36612,,"",""
Upscaling Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis and Related Agroecosystems Services in Smallholder Farming Systems,"","Abstract: Smallholder farming systems form unique ecosystems that can protect beneficial soil biota and form an important source of useful genetic resources. They are characterized by high level of agricultural diversity mainly focused on meeting farmers' needs. Unfortunately, these systems often experience poor crop production mainly associated with poor planning and resource scarcity. Soil fertility is among the primary challenges faced by smallholder farmers, which necessitate the need to come up with affordable and innovative ways of replenishing soils. One such way is the use of microbial symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a beneficial group of soil microbiota that form symbiotic associations with majority of cultivated crops and play a vital role in biological soil fertility, plant nutrition, and protection. AMF can be incorporated in smallholder farming systems to help better exploit chemical fertilizers inputs which are often unaffordable to many smallholder farmers. The present review highlights smallholder farming practices that could be innovatively redesigned to increase AMF symbiosis and related agroecosystem services. Indeed, the future of global food security depends on the success of smallholder farming systems, whose crop productivity depends on the services provided by well-functioning ecosystems, including soil fertility. ### Topics keywords: organic farming;land degradation;soil fertility;contract farming;mycorrhizal fungi;agro ecosystem;chemical fertilizer;CF;point view;smallholder farming;farming practice;pest control;farming system;long term;DM;genetic resource;arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi;FAO;management practice;food security;genetic diversity;AMF;arbuscular mycorrhizal;AM fungi;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture",2016,,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/4376240,,#36900,,"Ellen McCullough (2019-06-08 06:21:05)(Screen): AMF symbiosis is the outcome variable not productivity or incomes.

Use of Integrated Soil Fertility Management Technologies in Malawi: Impact of Dry Spells Exposure,"","Abstract: Integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) technologies hold potential to protect against climate risks, reduce nutrient depletion and enhance food security. In this paper, we study how exposure to dry spells influences use and use intensity of ISFM technologies, specifically focusing on maize-legume intercropping and organic manure. We use a four-round panel dataset collected from households in six Malawi districts over a period of nine years and merged with daily rainfall data from the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services. The results using correlated random effects models reveal that exposure to one-year lag of late-season dry spells is associated with high likelihood of use and use intensity of organic manure and maize-legume intercropping. However, there is an inconsistent effect of two-year and three-year lags of both early-season and late-season dry spells on the use and use intensity of both technologies. We respectively attribute these positive and inconsistent impacts to farmers' perceived and delayed benefits of the technologies under dry spells. We recommend that promotion messages should properly package the technologies to include those with immediate and delayed but enduring effects and sensitize the farmers on the same. ### Countries mentioned: Malawi ### Plant products search: legumes;maize ### Topics keywords: integrated soil fertility;organic farming;cover crop;climate change;chemical fertilizer;DM;soil fertility;organic manure;OM;FYM;organic matter;CC;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2019,,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.09.018,,#37149,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-08 06:11:41)(Screen): Outcome variable is ISFM adoption.

Use of provisioning ecosystem services drives loss of functional traits across land use intensification gradients in tropical forests in Madagascar,"","Abstract: Ecosystems services are threatened by the rapid degradation of tropical rainforests. In light of these threats, questions remain about how societies on the forest fringe who depend on provisioning services affect plant functional traits. This study assessed the relationship between plant functional traits, forest-dependent societies and provisioning ecosystem services along a forest-agriculture matrix gradient in tropical humid forests of Madagascar. Data were collected for six functional traits and six provisioning services. We evaluated functional diversity (FD) and utilitarian diversity (FD of provisioning services) along disturbance gradients. We also determined the traits most susceptible to loss along the gradient as well as the relationship between functional traits and provisioning services. The results showed that FD, utilitarian diversity and species richness decreased significantly across all modified habitats. There was a distinct suite of traits absent from intensely used habitats and those same traits were associated with the two most important provisioning services in the region (firewood and construction). The activities of people living on the forest fringe seem to be a strong selective force on trait loss in plant communities, which in turn will influence future species assembly and trait diversity and distribution. Moreover, this study suggests that it is possible to predict trait loss from plant communities in forests where degradation is mediated primarily through subsistence agriculture and resource extraction. Conservation efforts should recognize that forest degradation and deforestation are contextually specific, determined mostly by people's efforts to maintain their basic livelihood, and therefore necessitate local-scale interventions that feed into landscape-scale policy initiatives. ### Countries mentioned: Madagascar ### Programs found: policy initiative;landscape scale policy initiative ### Topics keywords: provisioning service;ecosystem service;oil palm;land use;specie richness;tropical forest;protected area;landscape scale ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2013,,Biological Conservation,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.03.014,,#36975,,"",""
Using full-scale duckweed ponds as the finish stage for swine waste treatment with a focus on organic matter degradation.,"","Abstract: The rapid increase in the number of swine has caused pronounced environmental impacts worldwide, especially on water resources. As an aggregate, smallholdings have an important role in South American pork production, contributing to the net diffusion of pollution. Thus, duckweed ponds have been successfully used for swine waste polishing, mainly for nutrient removal. Few studies have been carried out to assess organic matter degradation in duckweed ponds. Hence, the present study evaluated the efficiency of two full-scale duckweed ponds for organic matter reduction of swine waste on small pig farms. Duckweed ponds, in series, received the effluent after an anaerobic biodigester and storage pond, with a flow rate of 1 m day. After 1 year of monitoring, an improvement in effluent quality was observed, with a reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), respectively, of 94.8 and 96.7%, operating at a loading rate of approximately 27 kgBOD ha day and 131 kgCOD ha day. Algae inhibition due to duckweed coverage was strongly observed in the pond effluent, where chlorophyll a and turbidity remained below 25 µg L and 10 NTU. Using the study conditions described herein, duckweed ponds were shown to be a suitable technology for swine waste treatment, contributing to the environmental sustainability of rural areas. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Animal products search: pork ### Topics keywords: WWTP;BOD5;DM;environmental impact;COD;OM;BOD;full scale;flow rate;organic matter;rural area;chemical oxygen demand ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Water Science and Technology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2014.136,,#37567,,"",""
"Traditional agroforestry systems of multi-crop ""milpa"" and ""chichipera"" cactus forest in the arid Tehuacán Valley, Mexico: their management and role in people's subsistence.","","Abstract: Agroforestry systems (AFS) derived from the cactus forest ""chichipera"" and cultivated with ""milpa"", the traditional multi-crop system of maize-beans-squash were studied in the Tehuacán Valley, Mexico. Plant management types practiced by people, role of agricultural and forest resources in households' subsistence, and consequences of changes in AFS were investigated through ethnobotanical, ecological, and economic approaches. People maintain in this AFS 122 plant species that provide useful products for 14 different purposes. Nearly 90% of useful plants are native to the region, representing 54% of all plant species recorded in the chichipera forest. Management strategies were identified occurring on 63 species at landscape, parcel, and individual plant levels. About 67% of managed plant species are left standing during clearance of vegetation; 35% are transplanted to the parcels' surrounding area, 32% receive particular protection, and 10 species from other areas are cultivated inside the fields. During years of higher rainfall (∼745 mm) AFS supply nearly 75% of the maize grain and 50% of the maize straw used as fodder by households.

Transitioning India's public expenditure in agriculture towards higher growth and equity,"","Abstract: The study aimed to develop broader series of public expenditures and investments impacting growth of agriculture and allied sectors and explored how sectoral and regional priorities of agricultural investments had responded to the national priorities by tracing their growth linkages. The study indicated that following a period of stagnation in the 1990s, public expenditure on agriculture and allied sectors has stepped up in the mid-2000 decade. Further, the broad observations do not corroborate the idea of neglecting marginal agro-eco-regions as far as public investment in agricultural research is concerned. However, higher infrastructure and agricultural research investment priority should be given to relatively backward states of eastern India, as the region still has poor infrastructure and higher concentration of subsistence producers which make private sector hesitant to invest. Enhanced public investment is justified to strengthen infrastructure and also attract private investment leading to high pay-offs as the region is well endowed with natural resources. The other issue relates to prioritisation of public resources towards those sectors and regions where presence of market failures or core distributional concerns exists. The public resources should increasingly be deployed to produce goods and services that are not produced by market actors. The rising government spending under revenue account on agri-inputs and farm support services can also have a crowding-out effect on private investment. Studies have shown that the biggest payoffs for reducing rural poverty and increasing growth came from investments in R&D and infrastructure and that too from backward regions. These investments must, therefore, be treated as a composite strategy for rural development and a sustained step-up in investments should be maintained in order to benefit agriculture, given that the benefits from these investments tend to materialise after a considerable time lag. The policy shift towards raising capital expenditure in rural infrastructure and irrigation would translate into economic gains only, if it is backed by responsive institutions as they form part of the enabling environment for private investment. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: natural resource;rural household;rural poverty;R D;private sector;rural development;contract farming ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics,,,,,,,#36839,,"",""
"Typology of cattle fattening systems in the Pampa Region, Argentine.","","Abstract: The objective of the study was to identify and classify the production systems for bovine fattening in pastoral conditions in the semiarid Argentine Pampa taking into account the physical, productive and economic characteristics and its management. A sampling of 56 farms was performed at the Department of Quemú-Quemú, province of Pampa. Anova and cluster analysis were used to reduce the number of variables involved and to define farmer groups. Three pastoral subsystems were identified: first, second and third. The first subsystem was denominated by traditional grazing that responds to operations with low levels of productivity and daily average gain. In this system, 56% are perennial pastures and lasted for 23 months. This type of operation applied minimal expenses. The second subsystem is a transition between the traditional system and the technological system. The third subsystem is a technological grazing that utilizes greater levels of feed with 77% pasture that lasted for 17 months and shows higher levels of productivity and average daily gain. This type of operation maximizes the benefits for decision making. ### Countries mentioned: Argentina;United States ### Measurements for interventions: pasture ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;spatial distribution;trace element;CA;cluster analysis;taking account;decision making ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2006,,Archivos de Zootecnia,,,,,,,#36321,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-08 05:51:04)(Screen): It mentions a description of systems and their association with productivity.

Urban and Peri-urban Cultivation in Northern Mozambique: Impacts on Food Security Among Female Street Food Vendors,"","Abstract: This study investigates the impact of small-scale agricultural practices on income-generating activities for female street food vendors in urban and peri-urban areas in northern Mozambique. Female-headed households report greater food resources and income from gathering and cultivation despite longer work days. This creates new economic niches. Cultivation contributes to positive psychological outcomes; it reduces feelings of anomie and eases transitions from rural to urban settings. Cultivation provides a connection to tradition, serves as a cultural identifier, and allows women to earn money in gender-appropriate ways. These findings have policy implications for food security and livelihoods in urban centers, including the need for greater access to water and clean compost material to enhance yield. ### Countries mentioned: Mozambique ### Topics keywords: small scale;rural household;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2012,,Journal of Applied Social Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/1936724412444428,,#36412,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:17:30)(Screen): Outcome variable is off-farm income.; ,""
Use of low quality water for irrigation: major challenges.,"","Abstract: The future of irrigated agriculture poses the need to develop irrigation strategies using poorer quality water to fulfil the food and fibre production gap, in order to ensure long-term sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Recent technologies developed focusing on the proper management and practicability approaches on the use of saline water for irrigation are reviewed, highlighting the strategies that facilitate the use of poor quality irrigation waters, while, at the same time, minimizing the adverse impacts on soil productivity, crop production and the environment. There is usually no single way to practise and manage poor quality water for irrigation without long-term consequences to crop, soil and environment. Many different approaches and practices may be integrated and combined into a satisfactory control system. The proposed strategies for the use of poor quality water, although being too simplistic from the perspectives of economics, the management capabilities of farmers and the limitation of infrastructure which delivers irrigation water, are important to foster irrigation sustainability and limit environmental impacts. Without a comprehensive and long-term strategy adaptable to the prevailing economic, climatic, social, as well as edaphic and hydrogeological conditions, it is not considered possible to meet the future challenges of irrigated agriculture using poor quality water. ### Topics keywords: water saving;environmental impact;irrigated agriculture;long term",1999,,"Halophyte uses in different climates.

Thermodynamic modelling of an onsite methanation reactor for upgrading producer gas from commercial small scale biomass gasifiers,"","Abstract: Small scale biomass gasifiers have the advantage of having higher electrical efficiency in comparison to other conventional small scale energy systems. Nonetheless, a major drawback of small scale biomass gasifiers is the relatively poor quality of the producer gas. In addition, several EU Member States are seeking ways to store the excess energy that is produced from renewables like wind power and hydropower. A recent development is the storage of energy by electrolysis of water and the production of hydrogen in a process that is commonly known as “power-to-gas”. The present manuscript proposes an onsite secondary reactor for upgrading producer gas by mixing it with hydrogen in order to initiate methanation reactions. A thermodynamic model has been developed for assessing the potential of the proposed methanation process. The model utilized input parameters from a representative small scale biomass gasifier and molar ratios of hydrogen from 1:0 to 1:4.1. The Villar-Cruise-Smith algorithm was used for minimizing the Gibbs free energy. The model returned the molar fractions of the permanent gases, the heating values and the Wobbe Index. For mixtures of hydrogen and producer gas on a 1:0.9 ratio the increase of the heating value is maximized with an increase of 78%. For ratios higher than 1:3, the Wobbe index increases significantly and surpasses the value of 30 MJ/Nm3. ### Measurements for interventions: hydrogen ### Topics keywords: small scale;CAP;chemical fertilizer;EU;use efficiency;energy consumption;MJ;rural development;member state;EU member state",2018,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.044,,#37561,,"",Conflict
"The role of fish-poultry integration on fish growth performance, yields and economic benefits among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania","","Abstract: Aquaculture practices from sub-Saharan Africa are characterised by low production, owing to improper technology. Production can be increased through integrating fish farming with other existing on-farm activities, particularly livestock husbandry. We assessed the role of fish-poultry integration on all male Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus growth performance, yields and economic benefits among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania. The study also compared phytoplankton species composition, abundance and biomass between the fish-poultry integration and non-integrated system. After 180 days of the experiment, all male O. niloticus cultured under fish-poultry integration exhibited significantly higher growth rates than those in the non-integrated system (p < 0.05). Gross fish yield (GFY), net fish yield (NFY) and net annual yields (NAY) obtained from fish-poultry integration were significantly higher than those from non-integrated system (p < 0.05). Partial enterprise budget analysis revealed that fish-poultry integration was more profitable than the non-integrated system. Moreover, fish-poultry integrated system produced significantly higher phytoplankton abundance and biomass than those from the non-integrated system. Results demonstrate that rural smallholder farmers can achieve higher growth rate, farm net yields and income by integrating all male O. niloticus with other on-farm activities than practising a stand-alone fish culture system. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Animal products search: poultry meat;tilapia;fish ### Topics keywords: SSA;specie composition;specie richness;among smallholder farmer;economic benefit;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2018,,AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2018.1555512,,#37545,,"",Conflict
"Vegetable consumption and production in two municipalities in Ilocos Norte, Philippines.","","Abstract: This study focuses on vegetable production in the rainy season (May-October) in two municipalities in the province of Ilocos Norte, Philippines, with the objective of integrating surveys of small farm vegetable consumption and production into AVRDC crop management research. The relative market and subsistence orientation of farm households towards seven vegetable crops (tomatoes, mungbeans, sweet potatoes, cabbages, bell peppers, soyabeans, Chinese cabbages) in the area is discussed. Consumption of all the types of vegetables (excluding sweet potatoes) is less seasonal than originally hypothesized but more subsistence orientated. The findings suggest that farmers do not see potential for major increases in income through the production alternatives currently available for the seven noted vegetable crops, and the outstanding rainy season production alternative currently available to farm households (mungbean planted in August) fulfills subsistence needs rather than serving as a source of income. The results are taken from a dissertation by the senior author submitted to Louisiana State University, entitled ### Countries mentioned: Philippines;China;United States ### Plant products search: bell peppers;tomatoes;pepper;soybeans;sweet potatoes;potatoes;mungbean;leafy vegetables;mung beans ### Topics keywords: sweet potato;SP;family farming;NP ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1984,,"Technical Bulletin, Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC)",,,,,,,#37493,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:30:26)(Screen): No counterfactual.; ,Conflict
Waste treatment and biogas quality in small-scale agricultural digesters,"","Abstract: Seven low-cost digesters in Costa Rica were studied to determine the potential of these systems to treat animal wastewater and produce renewable energy. The effluent water has a significantly lower oxygen demand (COD decreased from 2968 mg/L to 472 mg/L) and higher dissolved nutrient concentration (NH 4 -N increased by 78.3% to 82.2 mg/L) than the influent water, which increases the usefulness of the effluent as an organic fertilizer and decreases its organic loading on surface waters. On average, methane constituted 66% of the produced biogas, which is consistent with industrial digesters. Through principle component analysis, COD, turbidity, NH 4 -N, TKN, and pH were determined to be the most useful parameters to characterize wastewater. The results suggest that the systems have the ability to withstand fluctuations in the influent water quality. This study revealed that small-scale agricultural digesters can produce methane at concentrations useful for cooking, while improving the quality of the livestock wastewater. ### Countries mentioned: Costa Rica ### Measurements for interventions: nutrient concentration;produced biogas;biogas ### Topics keywords: organic fertilizer;small scale;anaerobic digestion;sustainable development;COD;NH4;energy consumption;renewable energy;NO3;chemical oxygen demand;biogas production ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2008,,Bioresource Technology,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.09.090,,#37342,,Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-07 06:25:17)(Screen): nothing about water scarcity; ,Conflict
Sustainable agricultural production: an investigation in Brazilian semi-arid livestock farms,"","Abstract: This paper investigates the environmental sustainability and competitiveness perceptions of small farmers in a region in northern Brazil. The main data collection instruments included a survey questionnaire and an analysis of the region's strategic plan. In total, ninety-nine goat and sheep breeding farmers were surveyed. Data analysis methods included descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and chi-squared tests. The main results relate to the impact of education, land size, and location on the farmers' perceptions of competitiveness and environmental issues. Farmers with longer periods of education have higher perception scores about business competitiveness and environmental sustainability than those with less formal education. Farmers who are working larger land areas also have higher scores than those with smaller farms. Lastly, location can yield factors that impact on farmers' perceptions. In our study, farmers located in Angicos and Lajes had higher perception scores than Pedro Avelino and Afonso Bezerra, despite the geographical proximity of these municipalities. On the other hand, three other profile variables did not impact on farmers' perceptions, namely: family income, dairy production volume, and associative condition. The authors believe the results and insights can be extended to livestock farming in other developing countries and contribute generally to fostering effective sustainable development policies, mainly in the agribusiness sector. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil;Italy ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;land degradation;CA;livestock farming;developing country;point view;descriptive statistic;farming system;beef cattle;cluster analysis;farmer perception;farm size;animal health;management practice;animal husbandry;genetic diversity;spatial distribution;sustainable development;trace element;crop residue;extension service;dairy farming;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);IBRD",2014,,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.07.023,,#37331,,"",Conflict
"Remediation of abandoned saline soils using <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Glycyrrhiza glabra</i>: a study from the hungry steppes of Central Asia.","","Abstract: Large expansion of the irrigated area in the Aral Sea Basin has exacted a substantial toll on land and water resources in the region. Elevated water tables associated with poor irrigation management and inappropriate drainage infrastructure have resulted in significant secondary salinisation of crop lands resulting in declining cotton and wheat yields and eventual abandonment of lands. Costs associated with the installation of appropriate drainage infrastructure in order to reclaim these areas are prohibitive and hence alternative approaches are required that can be adopted by resource poor farmers. In the current study the potential use of (common name liquorice) to reclaim abandoned saline areas was assessed over a four year period before being returned to a cotton/wheat crop rotation. Two adjacent abandoned fields of 10 and 13 ha respectively were selected for the study on which two treatments were imposed, namely, a control that was maintained as a bare fallow between 1999 and 2003 and a treated plot where liquorice was established over this period. High quality livestock forage with a protein content of 12% was cut from the liquorice plot with dry matter yields ranging from 3.66 (±0.06) to 5.11 (±0.17) t ha. In addition, root dry matter yields of 5.63 (±1.19) to 8.55 (±0.82) t ha were recorded, this plant component being used in the preparation of herbal medicines and soft drinks. At the end of four years both plots were returned to a wheat and cotton crop rotation. Yields of wheat on the control and treated plots were 0.87 (±0.05) and 2.42 (±0.02) t ha respectively. Similarly substantial increases in cotton were observed with the control and treated plots yielding 0.31 (±0.01) and 1.89 (±0.18) t ha. These levels of production on the treated plot exceed the district average for wheat and cotton of 1.75 and 1.5 t ha respectively, clearly showing the positive benefit associated with the growing of liquorice. Water table levels after four years were maintained below the critical level of 2.5 m in the treated plots whilst rising to within 1.99 m from the surface in the control. Salt content of the soil in the treated plot declined over the study while those in the control increased. This preliminary study has clearly demonstrated the ameliorating affect of liquorice in bringing abandoned salt affected soils back into production that is low cost and could be adopted by resource poor farmers. ### Countries mentioned: Hungary ### Plant products search: cotton;wheat ### Measurements for crops: cotton;wheat ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;herbal medicine;chemical composition;crop rotation;DM;dry matter;protein content;medicinal plant ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2005,,International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2005.9684748,,#37259,,"",Conflict
"Studies on reproductive abscission and seed yield of mungbean (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Vigna radiata</i>) in sub-humid savanna of Nigeria.","","Abstract: A field study was conducted on the Research and Experimental Farm of the University of Agriculture Makurdi (7°41′N, 08°37′N, and 400 m above mean sea level), Nigeria, in 2001 and 2002 to examine the abscission of reproductive structures in mungbean . Four exotic cultivars (VC 2768A, VC 1178A, VC 2778A and VC 1973A) and a local cultivar (Ex-Zaria) were used for the study, which was laid out in a randomized complete block design and was replicated four times. Grain legumes generally undergo considerable abscission of their reproductive structures during flowering and fruiting stages. In this study the abscissions of flowers and pods differed widely among the cultivars. The abscissions of flowers and young pods varied from 14.4 to 36.8% and 12.3 to 38.5%, respectively. The number of flowers and harvestable pods per plant also varied from a high of 77.2 and 48.8 in VC 2768A to a low of 49.1 and 24.0 in VC 2778A, respectively. Conversely, young pods varied in number from 56.0 in VC 1973A to 38.9 in VC 2778A. In all the cultivars, more flowers occurred at the bottom of the canopy where abscission was also highest. The cultivar VC 2778A had highest (50.8) percent total abscission compared to the lowest of 29.1 percent in VC 1973A. Seed yield ranged from 541.67 kg/ha in VC 2778A to 2000.2 kg/ha in VC 2768A. Seed weight and the number of seeds per pod, however, did not vary significantly. There was a high positive correlation (r=0.94) between flowers and harvestable pods. Seed yield also correlated positively with the number of flowers, harvestable pods, seed weight and the number of seeds per pod. This study has shown that reproductive abscission exists in mungbean but it is of less intensity when compared to other legumes. The lower rate of abscission coupled with low incidences of pests and diseases and high nutritive value make the crop a dependable source of protein for resource-poor rural farmers in the tropics. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Plant products search: mungbean;grain;grain legumes;mung beans ### Measurements for interventions: pod ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;paddy field;value chain;plant height;cropping system;DM;seed pod;randomized complete block design;NH4;nutritive value;TP;seed weight;dry matter;NO3;grain legume;NH4 N;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2009,,"African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development",,,,,,,#37233,,"",Conflict
Simulating the impact of no-till systems on field water fluxes and maize productivity under semi-arid conditions,"","Abstract: Crop output from the smallholder farming sector in sub-Saharan Africa is trailing population growth leading to widespread household food insecurity. It is therefore imperative that crop production in semi-arid areas be improved in order to meet the food demand of the ever increasing human population. No-till farming practices have the potential to increase crop productivity in smallholder production systems of sub-Saharan Africa, but rarely do because of the constraints experienced by these farmers. One of the most significant of these is the consumption of mulch by livestock. In the absence of long term on-farm assessment of the no-till system under smallholder conditions, simulation modelling is a tool that provides an insight into the potential benefits and can highlight shortcomings of the system under existing soil, climatic and socio-economic conditions. Thus, this study was designed to better understand the long term impact of no-till system without mulch cover on field water fluxes and maize productivity under a highly variable rainfall pattern typical of semi-arid South Africa. The simulated on-farm experiment consisted of two tillage treatments namely oxen-drawn conventional ploughing (CT) and ripping (NT). The APSIM model was applied for a 95. year period after first being calibrated and validated using measured runoff and maize yield data. The predicted results showed significantly higher surface runoff from the conventional system compared to the no-till system. Predicted deep drainage losses were higher from the NT system compared to the CT system regardless of the rainfall pattern. However, the APSIM model predicted 62% of the annual rainfall being lost through soil evaporation from both tillage systems. The predicted yields from the two systems were within 50kgha-1 difference in 74% of the years used in the simulation. In only 9% of the years, the model predicted higher grain yield in the NT system compared to the CT system. It is suggested that NT systems may have great potential for reducing surface runoff from smallholder fields and that the NT systems may have potential to recharge groundwater resources through increased deep drainage. However, it was also noted that the APSIM model has major shortcomings in simulating the water balance at this level of detail and that the findings need to be confirmed by further field based and modelling studies. Nevertheless, it is clear that without mulch or a cover crop, the continued high soil evaporation and correspondingly low crop yields suggest that there is little benefit to farmers adopting NT systems in semiarid environments, despite potential water resources benefits downstream. In such cases, the potential for payment for ecosystem services should be explored. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Topics keywords: organic farming;soil erosion;drought stress;land degradation;CA;soil fertility;SA;household food insecurity;surface runoff;CC;SSA;conventional tillage;smallholder farming;farming practice;farming system;NT;long term;crop rotation;conservation tillage;soil organic carbon;carbon storage;management practice;ecosystem service;food insecurity;cover crop;crop residue;smallholder farmer;CT;sustainable agriculture;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2011,,Physics and Chemistry of the Earth,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pce.2011.07.069,,#37097,,"",Conflict
"Refinements to <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Hevea</i> rubber breeding.","","Abstract: (Willd. Ex. A. de. Juss. Müell-Arg.) is the prime source of natural rubber. Domestication of rubber began since 1876 with Wickham collecting 70,000 seeds from Upper Amazon and transported them to Kew Botanic Gardens. Somehow, rubber trees covering millions of hectares are believed to be derived from ""22 seedlings"" of Wickham's original stock. Improving dry rubber yield is the exclusive and ultimate objective of breeding with consistent yield of 70 to 80 g/tree/tapping. Ultimately, in a small holding, a planter must gain an average yield of around 2200 to 2400 kg/ha from his stand (under optimal conditions), after accommodating tree-to-tree variations due to stock-scion interactions and soil heterogeneity. This is arduous, but achievable. Initial production of high-yielding clones gave 1600 kg/ha against 496 kg/ha of unselected seedlings. Adaptation and yielding potential of clones to specific environments are optimized through localized experimentation. Studies on adaptation of clones to new environments, especially to sub-optimal or marginal areas, are gaining momentum. As this extension happens, demand for new clones is on the rise. Possibilities of using rubber trees for reforestation, carbon sequestration and application of genomics in deriving climate resilient clones may come up in future, which breeders may have to take up with required priority.

Variability in rainfall characteristics in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana.,"","Abstract: Increases in rainfall variability resulting from climate change can rapidly reduce land productivity and alter the composition of ecosystem, increase generation of runoff and flood with a concomitant rise in the rate of soil erosion and its attendant adverse effects. In a bid to contribute towards minimizing these adverse effects and lessen the impact of climate change through rainfall variability on the resource poor farmers, this study was conducted in the semideciduous forest zone of Ghana. Seventeen years (1997-2013) rainfall records were collected from Ghana Meteorological Agency and analysed for rainfall characteristics such as annual and seasonal amounts, kinetic energy and erosivity determined using Modified Fournier Index. The mean monthly rainfall distribution showed rainfall amount to vary with the months with a peak in June and October in the major (March-July) and minor (September-November) wet seasons respectively. The coefficients of variability of rainfall amount were 17%, 27% and 37% for the annual, major and minor seasons respectively. Annual rainfall decreased by 11.3% and 12.0% in 5 and 10-year intervals. The kinetic energy ranged from 25421-49006 J/m, 8859-22687 J/m and 5084-20336 J/m in the order of annual, major and minor seasons. The coefficients of variation of annual, major and minor season's erosivity were 44%, 50% and 82% respectively. The implications of the observed high variability in annual and seasonal rainfall amount, kinetic energy and erosivity values on ecosystem resilience were highlighted. It was concluded that appropriate conservation measures, particularly, during the peaks of rainfall are required for protection and sustainable use of soil resources in the semi-deciduous zone. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;cover crop;climate change;adverse effect;human health;CC ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2015,,European Water,,,,,,,#36950,,"",Conflict
Source of technical inefficiency of smallholder wheat farmers in selected waterlogged areas of Ethiopia: a translog production function approach.,"","Abstract: This study was undertaken to investigate the technical inefficiency and factors affecting efficiency of wheat production in water-logged areas of Arsi-robe and Digelu-tijo districts of Arsi zone in southeastern Oromia region, Ethiopia. Both purposive and two-stage sampling techniques were used. Primary data was collected from 157 randomly selected wheat producing farmers through a structured questionnaire. The translog production function analysis revealed that the mean technical efficiency of wheat producers in the study areas in the season were 55%. Given the present state of technology and input level, the result of the study suggests that there is plenty of scope to increase the output of wheat commodity by up to 45%. Education, gender, fragmentation (number of wheat plots), and access to input and output markets have negative coefficients in the inefficiency model. In addition to this, the study indicates scaling up/out of best farmers' practices in the use of recommended integrated soil, water and nutrient management practices is essential for improving the productivity of commercial wheat varieties grown under water-logged vertisols. Furthermore, sharing the benefits of improved technologies through informal education and field days in demonstration plots could be important possible interventions for obtaining maximum achievable wheat yield under the difficult growing conditions of water-logged vertisols in Ethiopia. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: wheat ### Measurements for crops: wheat ### Topics keywords: technical efficiency;technical inefficiency;mean technical efficiency;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2013,,African Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,,,#36946,,"",Conflict
Vulnerability to food insecurity and households' coping strategies,"","Abstract: Nearly, a billion people globally are food insecure. Over 90 per cent of them are from sub-Saharan African countries, of which Ethiopia is part. The country has been renounced by its food insecurity level and dependent on food aid for decades. Severity of food insecurity in the country is mainly deep in rural areas and smallholder farmers are vulnerable to the shocks of food shortage. The aim of this study is to assess household's vulnerability to food insecurity and coping strategies with evidence from southern Ethiopia. In this study, universal coping strategy questions were used to answer ""What do farmers do when they don't have enough food, and don't have enough money to buy food?"" The finding indicates that about 79.2 per cent of households are vulnerable to food insecurity and responded to food shortage shocks in different ways. Over half of the respondents reduced meal frequency and consumed enset (is a false banana grown in southern and south western part of Ethiopia which is used to cope food shortages during drought seasons) while others consumed less preferred food (44.2 per cent). The rest adapted asset depleting strategies like borrowing grain (35.4 per cent), using saved money (27.5 per cent), and selling livestock (25 per cent) to cope with food insecurity. This shows that unless asset building and income enhancing strategies are promoted; vulnerable people will deplete assets and fall in chronic food insecurity. The average coping strategy is 13.4 while it is 16.4 for the very poor households implying that they face more severe food insecurity than non-poor households. Therefore, in order to build the resilience of rural households towards food shortage shocks, asset transfer strategies, access to credit services, and diverse income generating enterprises should be promoted. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: grain;bananas ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;access credit;coping strategy;SSA;rural household;food insecure;farm size;extension service;smallholder farmer;rural area ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2015,,Journal of Rural Development,,,,,,,#36771,,"",Conflict
Readily available water access is associated with greater milk production in grazing dairy herds,"","Abstract: In Santa Catarina, Brazil, most milk is produced on small-scale farms that utilize grazing as the main form of nutrition; however, the farms differ in how they provide water for their herds, with some herds not providing access to drinking water while on pasture and other herds having unrestricted access to water.

Herds with unrestricted access to drinking water produced more milk than herds that had restricted access to drinking water, regardless of the main breed of the herd, and amount of concentrate offered per cow per day. Simple changes in water management practices may positively impact milk production. Abstract: In this cross-sectional study, we measured the association between water provision and milk production on intensively managed small-scale grazing dairy herds. Farms (n = 53) were categorized according to water provision as follows: (1) Restricted—cows did not have access to a water trough while on pasture; and (2) Unrestricted—cows had free access to a water trough while on pasture. Herd main breed and feeding practices were included in a model to assess the effect of water provision category on farm average milk yield/cow/d. The effect of pasture condition and environmental variables on milk production were also assessed, however were not retained on the final model. Herds provided with unrestricted access to drinking water produced on average 1.7 L more milk per cow/d (p = 0.03) than herds with restricted access to drinking water. Predominantly Holstein herds produced 2.8 L more milk per cow/d (p < 0.01) than non-Holstein herds. Each extra kg of concentrate offered per day increased milk yield by 1.1 L/cow/d (p < 0.01). In conclusion, providing free access to drinking water while grazing was associated with greater milk production. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: milk yield ### Topics keywords: small scale;animal welfare;dairy cow;dairy industry;drinking water;dairy farm;dairy herd;dairy cattle;management practice ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2019,,Animals,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9020048,,#36667,,"",Conflict
"VALUING IRRIGATION WATER IN PUNJAB PROVINCE, PAKISTAN: A LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPROACH","","Abstract: ABSTRACT: Linear programming models of a representative farm in a district of Pakistan's Punjab Province are formulated for the purpose of estimating the value of irrigation water. The models provide for choices among several irrigation levels for each potential crop. Solutions of the model for several water supply situations provide the basis for approximating the total, average, and marginal values of irrigation water. Prices for important crops in Pakistan are controlled at levels below their levels elsewhere in the world, so models are specified for both financial (domestic price) and economic (world price) scenarios. The value of water to society (its economic value) is high relative to the costs of some generally available water‐augmenting investments, while financial values, which measure water management and allocation incentives faced by farmers, are less than the corresponding economic values. At current water supply levels, incremental returns to added water estimated from the economic model would justify investments in water‐saving or water‐augmenting technologies, while such a decision would be barely attractive assuming financial prices. While present government commodity price policies may serve to protect low‐income and non‐farm members of the population, they also inhibit farmer investments to increase the productivity of scarce irrigation water. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan ### Topics keywords: water saving;short term;factor influencing;commodity price ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",1989,,JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.1989.tb05421.x,,#36655,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:11:42)(Screen): Focuses on the productivity of water use for the purpose of setting water prices rather than farm productivity / returns.; ,Conflict
"Smallholder Farming of the Greater Cane Rat, Thryonomys swinderianus, Temminck, in Southern Ghana: A Baseline Survey of Management Practices","","Abstract: Baseline management practices and productivity of captive greater cane rats were studied between February and July 1992 using questionnaires with 33 practising and former farmers in 16 villages in three regions in southern Ghana. The colony sizes were relatively small, ranging between 1 and 96, with nearly a 100% farmer drop-out rate. The mean litter size of the greater cane rats in this study was 4.8 ± 0.13, with the young being weaned at 8.8 weeks old. Although nearly all the farmers interviewed (90.9%) had long-term commercial intentions, a number of problems militating against their objectives were encountered. These included lack of technical support on proper management practices for efficient production, housing design, dry season feeding, sex determination and the acquisition of foundation stock. In conclusion, these studies have shown the generally poor state of the greater cane rat industry in Ghana, which requires research into almost all aspects of the productivity of this animal under captive breeding. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Measurements for interventions: cane ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;soil fertility;smallholder farming;human activity;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;farming system;management practice;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1999,,Tropical Animal Health and Production,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005267110830,,#36588,,"",Conflict
Spatiotemporal Variation Characteristics of Ecosystem Service Losses in the Agro-Pastoral Ecotone of Northern China,"","Abstract: Being subject to climate change and human intervention, the land-use pattern in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China has undergone complex changes over the past few decades, which may jeopardize the provision of ecosystem services. Thus, for sustainable land management, ecosystem services should be evaluated and monitored. In this study, based on Landsat TM/ETM data, we quantitatively evaluated the losses of ecosystem service values (ESV) in three sections of the agro-pastoral ecotone from 1980-2015. The results were as follows: (1) the main characteristic of the land conversions was that a large area of grassland was converted into cultivated land in the agro-pastoral ecotone; (2) on the spatial scale, the ESV losses of the agro-pastoral ecotone can be called an inclined surface in the direction of the northeast to southwest, and the northeastern section of the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV than the middle and northwest sections (p 1980-1990 > 2000-2015; (3) the agro-pastoral ecotone lost more ESV, which was mainly due to four kinds of land conversion, which were grassland that was transformed into cultivated land, grassland transformed into unused land, grassland transformed into built-up areas, and cultivated land transformed into built-up areas; (4) although these land conversions were curbed after the implementation of protection policies at the end of the 1990s, due to reduced precipitation and increasing temperatures, the agro-pastoral ecotone will face a more severe situation in the future; and, (5) during the period of 1990-2015, the overall dynamic processes of increasing population gradually expanded to the sparsely populated pastoral area. Therefore, we believe that human interventions are the main cause of ecological deterioration in the agro-pastoral ecotone. This study provides references for fully understanding the regional differences in the ecological and environmental effects of land use change and it helps to objectively evaluate ecological civilization construction in the agro-pastoral ecotone of Northern China. ### Countries mentioned: China ### Topics keywords: unused land;land degradation;LUC;land cover;trace metal;large scale;SLM;traditional medicine;land use change;spatial scale;cultivated land;medicinal plant;ecosystem service;cover crop;climate change;provision ecosystem service;trace element;land use;specie richness;CC ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2019,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16071199,,#36524,,"",Conflict
Variation in soil properties under different land use types managed by smallholder farmers along the toposequence in southern Ethiopia.,"","Abstract: Understanding soil properties under different land use types along toposequences is vital in determining the types of soil management practices that could be implemented by smallholder farmers for improving the soil health as well as soil productivity. It is also important in addressing the issues of agricultural sustainability. With the objectives of investigating variation in soil properties under different land use types managed by smallholder farmers along the toposequences, three land use types: agroforestry land (AG), cultivated land (CL) and grazing land (GL) under three slope categories (upper, middle and lower slope) were selected in southern Ethiopia, Deko watershed. A total of 108 composite soil samples [3 treatments (land use types) -3 replications -3 slope categories (upper, middle and lower) -4 soil depth layers: 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-60 cm and >60 cm] were collected for laboratory analyses. In addition, undisturbed soil samples were taken using core sampler from each soil depth for the determination of soil bulk density. To infer the biological properties of the soils naked eye soil macro-fauna (NEMF) was counted. The results showed that among the soil properties sand (p<0.001), clay (p=0.002), soil bulk density (p<0.001), soil reaction (pH, p<0.001), Electrical conductivity (EC, p<0.001), Soil organic carbon (SOC%, p<0.001), Total nitrogen (TN%, p=0.001) and NEMF (p<0.001) have shown a significant variation among the land use types while sand (p=0.027), silt (p=0.001), clay (p<0.001), SOC (p<0.001) and TN (p=0.002) exhibiting significant variation among the slope categories. Similarly, variation of soil bulk density (p<0.001), soil pH (p<0.001), SOC (p<0.001), TN (p=0.002) and NNEMF (p<0.001) were also statistically significant along the soil depth. Clay was the dominant soil textural fraction showing an increasing trend along the toposequence. Agroforestry land use type has the higher SOC, TN, pH values and EC while cultivated land use type having relatively low amount of SOC, TN, pH and EC. The lower values on cultivated land use types were due to the effects of continuous tillage practices by the smallholder farmers in the area. Slope had minimum effect on soil pH, EC, soil bulk density and the number of observable macro-faunas in the area. Moreover, SOC and TN were increased down the slope on the cultivated land use types of the area. The role of erosion is magnificent in removing SOC and TN from upper slope to lower slope as the area is more vulnerable to erosion due rugged topography. Thus, applying soil and water conservation measures on cultivated land use types play a vital role in minimizing the removal of soils down the slope. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: EC;cropping system;soil fertility;DOC;tillage practice;bulk density;TN;NT;precision agriculture;soil organic carbon;cultivated land;OC;TP;energy consumption;management practice;land use;organic carbon;grain legume;smallholder farmer;electrical conductivity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2017,,Geoderma,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.11.021,,#36512,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:32:40)(Screen): Outcome variable is soil quality not yields/income.; ,Conflict
"Use of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">hapas</i> to produce Nile tilapia (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Oreochromis niloticus</i> L.) seed in household foodfish ponds: a participatory trial with small-scale farming households in Northwest Bangladesh.","","Abstract: Seed production of Nile tilapia ( L.) in nylon mesh net cages was tested through a participatory on-farm trial with households in NW Bangladesh. A total of 43 households with small ponds (0.04-0.08 ha) located close to the homesteads were sampled from poor to medium social groups in three communities: Tarala Banara (TB), Dewnaghata (DW) and Dola Para (DP). Broodfish of GIFT strain Nile tilapia (12 female and 6 male; 60 g size) were stocked in a single spawning (3×2×1 m). Swim-up fry were collected from breeding at 15 day intervals and stocked alternately in two nursing (1.5×1×1 m). With the exception of 15 households at DP in which flooding caused loss of fish, most of the households in TB and DW produced tilapia fry from for 4-5 months in addition to the usual production of foodfish/fingerlings in their ponds. Mean swim-up fry production in TB and DW was 5185±3764 and 3415±1536 fry household, leading to nursed fry production of 2708±1967 and 1380±734 fry household respectively. Nursed fry were sold (70%) or re-stocked (30%) for foodfish production in the participants' own ponds. Only households with perennial ponds that were able to hold and rear tilapia broodfish (25% of total households at TB and DW) successfully produced seed in Year 2, but such households started earlier in the season (March) and achieved significantly higher productivity than the previous year. productivity was impacted by local soil type, presence of shade, depth of mud and level of drainage inputs; more fry were produced in ponds based on sandy and sandy-loam soils with less overhanging vegetation and shade, lower levels of turbidity and benthic mud, and no drainage connections with tube wells or surface run-off. Poorer households were more successful overall and tended to prioritise sale of fry over retention for foodfish culture Households engaged in ancillary fry trading and/or nursery businesses also tended to be relatively successful. Between 8 and 20 customers were supplied by each operator, indicating the broader impacts of local seed production on grow-out for foodfish production. ### Countries mentioned: Bangladesh ### Plant products search: tuber ### Animal products search: tilapia;fish ### Measurements for interventions: fry ### Topics keywords: small scale;paddy field;CAP;plant height;drought stress;direct payment;dry weight ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2011,,Aquaculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.04.005,,#36494,,"",Conflict
Using visual stimuli to explore the social perceptions of ecosystem services in cultural landscapes: the case of transhumance in Mediterranean Spain.,"","Abstract: The ecosystem services approach has been proposed as a powerful tool for the analysis of coupled social-ecological systems. This approach is particularly useful for the evaluation of cultural landscapes, which represent the joint evolution of humans and nature across an extended time span. Transhumance is a customary practice of mobile pastoralism, involving the regular seasonal migration of livestock herds between summer and winter pasturelands. This practice maintains unique cultural landscapes in Mediterranean Spain, which have been shaped over many centuries of pastoral activity. Drove roads, which are used for herd migration, represent the most outstanding feature of these landscapes. We used visually based landscape interpretation to evaluate social perceptions of ecosystem services provided by the Conquense Drove Road transhumance landscape in Spain. Face-to-face questionnaires (N=314) were given to a sample of local inhabitants, visitors, and urban inhabitants. The questionnaires contained two pairs of photographs depicting images of croplands and pine forests associated with the transhumance landscape, with one photograph in each pair containing a drove road. We compared the social perceptions of 16 ecosystem services supplied by these two landscapes. These 16 services were divided into 3 types: provisioning, such as the production of food and water; regulating, such as the control of climate and disease; and cultural, such as spiritual and recreational benefits. We also identified differences between landscapes with and without a drove road. Overall, respondents recognized the higher capacity of forests to deliver a wider range of ecosystem services to society compared with croplands. Provisioning services were mostly associated with cropland, whereas regulating services and cultural ecosystem services tended to be related to forests. All three types of ecosystem services were more perceived by respondents when a drove road was present in each landscape. However, differences in the visual perception of ecosystem services supply and preference for transhumance landscapes emerged in relation to certain socio-demographic and cultural respondent characteristics such as a previous relationship with transhumance and agriculture, rural/urban origin and identity, environmental awareness, and cultural attachment to a place. Four groups of respondents had consistent and diverging ecosystem services appreciation, revealing various potential conflicts and trade-offs. We discuss the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach for evaluating ecosystem services in cultural landscapes and for informing policy-making processes. ### Countries mentioned: Spain ### Measurements for interventions: ecosystem service ### Topics keywords: trade offs;provisioning service;ecosystem service;human health;environmental impact;NH4;ecosystem service provided;NO3;crop residue;pest control;wide range ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Ecology and Society,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5751/ES-06401-190227,,#36315,,"",Conflict
Sonar sensing predicated automatic spraying technology for orchards,"","Abstract: Wastage of chemical inputs and environmental degradation have been a serious issues with conventional methods of pesticide application in agricultural and horticultural engenderment, resulting in fruit poisoning. A tractor-operated low-cost, ultrasonic sensor predicated selective pesticide sprayer was developed and tested for efficient spraying on the plant canopy and to abstain from spraying in canopy absentia. Sensing technology was interfaced with programmed Atmega328P for automatic spray control through pump, solenoid valves and nozzles. The sensing signals instigated the microcontroller system for desired spraying. The sprayer was evaluated with two different types of nozzles for optimal input resulting in best spray coverage and impact fruit infection. Water sensitive papers were used for estimation of spray characteristics. The turbo nozzle sprayer resulted in 47.41% of spray coverage, 171 drops/cm 2 with 26% of pesticide savings and considerably prevented fruit infection up to 95.64%. This proved to be much better than hollow cone nozzle spraying. The technology was provisioned for boom height and nozzle angle adjustment as per canopy geometry. The ultrasonic sensor sprayer was designed for low cost and precise pesticide spraying especially for marginal farmers, thereby reducing both costs and environmental pollution by plant protection products. ### Plant products search: fruits ### Programs found: interface program ### Measurements for interventions: pesticide ### Topics keywords: flow rate;human health;environmental pollution;chemical fertilizer",2018,,Current Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.18520/cs/v115/i6/1115-1123,,#36312,,"",Conflict
Use of climate information in soybean farming on the Argentinean pampas,"","Abstract: The availability of enhanced climate forecasts offers the potential for farmers to improve responses to climate variability. However, few studies have demonstrated actual effective uses of climate forecasts. Through interaction with regional agricultural experts, we evaluated the opportunities and constraints involved in the use of climate information in decision making regarding soybean farming in the Argentinean pampas. Our results showed that opportunities exist for the successful application of climate information, but consistent with previous research, there is a need to consider the broad and complex context influencing decisions, since climate is just one of the many factors affecting farmers' decisions. More importantly, we showed that adaptive management strategies proposed by experts in response to hypothetical climate scenarios produced diverging economic outcomes (both positive and negative). We hypothesized that inconsistency of the observed results could be due to a poor understanding by the agricultural experts of the impacts on regional climate of global climate signals (e.g. a given ENSO phase). An alternative hypothesis was that crop consultants had difficulties in anticipating the agronomic outcomes of management decisions made in response to a given climate forecast. Further research is needed to elucidate to what extent these hypotheses are valid. However, our results suggest that the mere availability of climate forecasts will not necessarily benefit growers. In order for there to be an improvement in the use of seasonal forecasts, appropriate interventions are necessary to enhance decision makers' understanding of the sources and impacts of climate variability, and of the consequences of different responses to a range of climate scenarios. ### Countries mentioned: Argentina ### Plant products search: soybeans ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;climate change;decision maker;growing season;decision making;climate variability;human activity;factor affecting;long term ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2007,,CLIMATE RESEARCH,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3354/cr033123,,#36285,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:16:26)(Screen): This paper is based on an expert consultation.

Soyabean response to rhizobium inoculation across sub-Saharan Africa: Patterns of variation and the role of promiscuity,"","Abstract: Improving bacterial nitrogen fixation in grain legumes is central to sustainable intensification of agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. In the case of soyabean, two main approaches have been pursued: first, promiscuous varieties were developed to form effective symbiosis with locally abundant nitrogen fixing bacteria. Second, inoculation with elite bacterial strains is being promoted. Analyses of the success of these approaches in tropical smallholder systems are scarce. It is unclear how current promiscuous and non-promiscuous soyabean varieties perform in inoculated and uninoculated fields, and the extent of variation in inoculation response across regions and environmental conditions remains to be determined. We present an analysis of on-farm yields and inoculation responses across ten countries in Sub Saharan Africa, including both promiscuous and non-promiscuous varieties. By combining data from a core set of replicated on farm trials with that from a large number of farmer-managed try-outs, we study the potential for inoculation to increase yields in both variety types and evaluate the magnitude and variability of response. Average yields were estimated to be 1343 and 1227 kg/ha with and without inoculation respectively. Inoculation response varied widely between trials and locations, with no clear spatial patterns at larger scales and without evidence that this variation could be explained by yield constraints or environmental conditions. On average, specific varieties had similar uninoculated yields, while responding more strongly to inoculation. Side by side comparisons revealed that stronger responses were observed at sites where promiscuous varieties had superior uninoculated yields, suggesting the availability of compatible, effective bacteria as a yield limiting factor and as a determinant of the magnitude of inoculation response. ### Plant products search: soybeans;grain;grain legumes ### Measurements for interventions: inoculation ### Topics keywords: sustainable intensification;spatial distribution;cropping system;SSA;CA;land use;spatial pattern;large scale;grain legume;smallholder farmer;farming system;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2018,,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2017.08.016,,#36267,,"",Conflict
"Spatio-temporal dynamics of gross rainfall partitioning and nutrient fluxes in shaded-cocoa (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Theobroma cocoa</i>) systems in a tropical semi-deciduous forest.","","Abstract: Land-use change from forest to cocoa agroforestry and other tree-based farming systems alters the structure of forest stands and influences the magnitude of canopy water fluxes and subsequent bio-element inputs to the forest floor. The partitioning of incident rainfall (IR) into throughfall (TF), stemflow (SF) and canopy interception loss (IL) and their associated nutrient element concentrations and fluxes was examined along a replicated chrono-sequence: forest, 3, 15 and 30-year-old smallholder shaded-cocoa systems in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Mean annual precipitation during the 2-year observational period (2007 and 2008) was 1376.2±93.8 mm. TF contributed between 76.5-90.4%, and SF between 1.4-1.7% of the annual IR to the forest floor. There were significant differences in IR, TF and SF chemistry. While TF and SF were enriched in phosphorus (1.33-5.67-fold), potassium (1.1-5.69 fold), calcium (1.35-2.65 fold) and magnesium (1.4-2.68 fold) relative to IR, total N (NH+NO) declined (0.5-0.91) of IR values in TF and SF in forest and shaded cocoa systems. Incident rainfall was significantly more acidic than TF and SF in both forest and shaded-cocoa systems. Mean annual total N, P, K, Ca and Mg inputs to the forest floor through IR were 5.7, 0.14, 13.6, 9.43 and 5.6 kg ha year respectively. Though an important source of available nutrients for plant growth, incident rainfall provides only a small percentage of the annual nutrient requirements. With declining soil fertility and pervasive low cocoa yields, possible effects of the reported nutrient fluxes on nutrient budgets in cocoa systems merit further investigation. Against the background of increased TF and decreased IL following forest conversion to shaded-cocoa, it is also recommended that more studies be carried out on rainfall partitioning and its impact on ground water recharge as a way of establishing its influence on the availability of moisture for agriculture in these systems. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Measurements for interventions: IR ### Topics keywords: land use change;inverse relationship;TN;soil fertility;land use;specie richness;significant difference;LUC;NH4;secondary forest;TP;farm size;NO3;farming system ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2018,,Agroforestry Systems,,,,,,,#36265,,"",Conflict
Variability of rainfall and yield of maize at the Brazilian semiarid through multivariate analysis,"","Abstract: The productivity of several agricultural crops is highly dependent on the rainfall supply, as well as their frequency and intensity. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the spatial behavior of maize precipitation and yield in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The main components analysis (PCA) and Pearson's correlation analysis of the variables for the period from 1990 to 2014 were used. Through these techniques, the high variability of the data on a year-to-year scale was verified, revealing the most important areas. Propitious to maize cultivation, as well as areas with the lowest yields and thus, more affected by water stress. In most of the territory corn yield is less than 1000 kg ha(-1). The variability of maize yield in the last decades is closely related to climatic variability, since it is subsistence agriculture and a dry land system. The effect of rainfall on maize productivity was statistically positive, that is, in most of the Brazilian semi-arid region, grain production efficiency is dependent on local rainfall. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Plant products search: maize;grain;wheat ### Topics keywords: spatial distribution;last decade;trace element;CA;point view;large scale;human activity;principal component analysis;factor affecting;PCA ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2019,,NATIVA,,,,,https://doi.org/10.31413/nativa.v7i1.6243,,#36260,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:47:41)(Screen): Climate (rainfall) impacts on yield.

Production characteristics and gender roles in dairy farming in peri-urban areas of eastern and central Africa,"","Abstract: In the recent past, dairy farming has increasingly become an important source of livelihoods for urban and peri-urban dwellers in Eastern and Central Africa. A study was carried out on dairy cattle farming in peri-urban areas of Machakos and Wote towns in the semi-arid region of Kenya and in Masaka, a peri-urban area in the sub-humid region of central Uganda. The objective was to understand the functioning of the existing dairy production systems and division of labour among gender in the enterprise. In peri-urban areas of Machakos and Masaka towns, 60 households at each site and 56 households in Wote were interviewed using structured questionnaires between February and July 2010. The study revealed that households in peri-urban areas of semi-arid Kenya had a relatively larger dairy herd size (5.3±3.7animals) than in peri-urban sub-humid Uganda (2.23±1.53 animals). Holstein-Friesian was the dominant breed (60% of breed) kept in Kenya while in Uganda crosses of local and exotic European breeds were dominant (80%).The semi-intensive system was the main production system in peri-urban semi-arid Kenya (54.8%) while in peri-urban Uganda, stall-feeding was the most preferred system (60%). Milk production per cow was generally low in both regions. In Kenya, it ranged from 3.4 litres/cow/day during the dry season to 9 litres/cow/day during the wet season. In Uganda, the average milk production was 3.5 litres/cow/day during the dry season and increased to 7.7 litres/cow/day during the wet season. Low rainfall was the major constraint in fodder and pasture establishment and was reported by over 70% of farmers in Kenya while in Uganda, high cost of seed (reported by 33% of farmers) was the most important constraint. The labour contribution among gender for different activities in dairy production was variable. In peri-urban areas of Kenya, men contributed highest labour in spraying animals against ticks and planting fodder (20-29% of total labour requirement) while women contributed more labour in milking (32-34%) than in any other activity. On contrast, women contributed over 50% of total labour in all activities required for running the dairy unit in Uganda. Children contributed less than 10% of labour requirements in most of the activities in both countries. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Uganda ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: fodder;milk production ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;dairy farming;herd size;dairy cow;dairy industry;dairy farm;dairy herd;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2012,,Livestock Research for Rural Development,,,,,,,#36201,,"",Conflict

Viability of organic farming in the hills of Uttarakhand.,"","Abstract: In Uttarakhand most of the hill farmers are resource-poor, and therefore apply very low level of chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides. As a result, hill soils are almost free from residues of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. This is a very strong point in favour of Uttarakhand for becoming a successful 'organic state'. Uttarakhand can enjoy a number of benefits from the adoption of organic farming. The price premiums for the products, conservation of the natural resources in terms of improved soil fertility and water quality, prevention of soil erosion, preservation of natural and agro-biodiversity are major benefits. Economic and social benefits like generation of rural employment, lower urban migration, improved household nutrition, local food security and reduced dependence on external inputs will be large gains in the hill conditions. The protection of environment and the consequent increase in the quality of human life will be other contributions of organic farming. Organic Farming has the twin objective of the system sustainable and environmentally sensitive, in order to achieve these two goals, it has develops some rules and standards which must be strictly adhered. There is very little scope for change and flexibility. Thus, the Organic Farming does not require best use of options available rather the best use of options that have been approved. That's why lack of inputs being a general problem among producers. Also, to encourage organic farming, market support system need be strengthened. ### Topics keywords: organic farming;soil erosion;natural resource;chemical fertilizer;DM;soil fertility;CF;price premium;willingness pay;contract farming;food security",2011,,Annals of Horticulture,,,,,,,#36871,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:05:52)(Screen): This study doesn't appear to have a counterfactual.; ,""

Using a simplified model derived from the residual imputation approach (the Change in Net Income Model) we assess the value of water in irrigated paddy and hydropower generation in the Great Ruaha River Catchment (GRRC) in Tanzania. The estimated productivity of water (PW) in irrigated paddy ranges from 0.059 to 0.250 kg/m 3 (for withdrawn water) and 0.126 to 0.265 kg/m 3 (for consumed water). The PW in hydropower generation is estimated to range from 0.45 to 1.68 kWh/m 3 . In monetary terms the value of water in irrigated paddy is estimated at 15.3 Tanzanian shilling (Tsh)/m 3 (for water withdrawn) and 0.19 Tsh/m 3 (for water consumed). The values of water for hydropower generation are relatively higher than for irrigated paddy, ranging from 59 to 226 Tsh/m 3 . Yet, irrigated paddy also supports livelihoods of about 30,000 agrarian families in the GRRC, with gross revenue of about Tsh 15.9 million per annum and GRCC paddy contributes about 14-24% of national rice production. We conclude that understanding the value of water in its alternative uses is key to fostering informed debate on water management and allocation, identifying the basis for making 'agreeable' trade-offs, the potential for improvement and creating linkages with water allocation options particularly in agricultural-based economies, where agriculture competes with other sectors and where water re-allocation decisions may involve large transfers of water from the sector generating the highest pro-poor returns (agriculture for this case) to the sectors generating the highest economic returns (hydropower generation and industrial uses). ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: trade offs;net income;ecosystem service;environmental impact;economic benefit;crop residue ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2008,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.03.008,,#37345,,"",""
The village level impact of machine threshing and implications for technology development in semi-arid tropical India.,"","Abstract: In order to make a sound case for public sector research in threshing and related post-harvest technology, it has first to be shown that the market for mechanical innovations does not function properly and why. Secondly, the need for new technologies has to be demonstrated to ensure that they have a reasonable chance of adoption, and when accepted by farmers will have a beneficial impact on society. The study looks at the second or ""consequences"" condition and measures the effects on cost, output, and employment from the introduction of mechanical threshers at the village level in SAT India. After a brief review of innovations in mechanical threshing in India, several conceptual issues that condition consequences in SAT India are outlined. This outline provides a framework for taking detailed assessment of the village level consequences of the diffusion of threshers over time. Because direct output effects from new threshing technologies are likely to be small, the private profitability of machine threshers and the size of cost reduction vis-a-vis traditional techniques are central themes for analysis. Particular attention is given to price determination for machine hiring within the village economy. The paper concludes with comments on implications for research policy on potential threshing technologies in SAT India. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: post harvest;insect pest;public sector;contract farming;DOC ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1981,,"Progress Report, Economics Program, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics",,,,,,,#36309,,"",""

Smart Nozzle: Application of phytosanitaries in fruit trees according to tree's electronic analysis,"","Abstract: The Uruguay fruit growing activity is predominately done by small-scale producers, where the producer has a single sprayer which he uses for all the applications throughout his orchard. At the same time the broth concentration (water plus plant protection product) applied per hectare is a function of the volume of vegetation of the fruit trees. Since vegetation volume varies within the different quadrants and cultivars in the fruit farm, broth concentration is determined by the worst case; i.e., for the quadrant with greatest vegetative volume. This leads to the application of excessive doses of pesticides to the fruit trees with smaller vegetative mass, which means unnecessary chemical products are applied, which increase the cost of production. Additionally, this over application can potentially pose, serious risks for the environment and/or consumers. As a solution to this problem, a prototype was designed and built, which detects the volume of vegetation and apply the appropriate dose in real time. This prototype can be adapted to any standard sprayer, reducing the cost of implementation. Field test show a reduction of the amount of phytosanitary product used, thereby reducing the environmental risk of contamination. It also lowers farming costs and improves efficiency in the application of pesticides, which increases the quality of the fruits, by reducing the risk of pesticide residues in the final product. The modified sprayer uses an electronic unit equipped with a digital control device to detect the cross sections of tree canopies at different heights and spray a flow proportional to the vegetation volume. The prototype also gives the farmer the means for better planning and control of the spray applications because it determines its position automatically using a GPS and keeps a record of the quantities of plant protection product applied at each site, at a low cost of implementation. ### Countries mentioned: Uruguay ### Plant products search: fruits ### Topics keywords: small scale;short term;precision agriculture;real time;GPS;pesticide residue;DDT;raw material;agricultural machinery;fruit tree;final product;agroforestry system;large scale;flow rate;decision making;GIS;small scale producer;ICT ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,"2017 IEEE URUCON, URUCON 2017",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/URUCON.2017.8171870,,#37002,,"",Observational
Reallocating water from agriculture to the environment under a voluntary purchase program.,"","Abstract: This article examines the performance of a federal programme in Nevada's Lahontan Valley (USA) under which water rights are purchased from willing sellers for environmental restoration. Based on a data set combining information on growers' personal and financial characteristics with physical characteristics of their farms, a model is estimated that explains who sells their water rights to the government. The sample comprised 65 observations, with 30 sellers and 35 non-sellers [date not given]. Results indicate that personal characteristics, especially short-term financial constraints, have a powerful influence on the sales decision. This finding suggests that environmental agencies may wish to more actively target growers operating on poor quality soils or on the periphery of irrigation projects to attain a more efficient outcome. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Plant products search: stone fruits ### Programs found: irrigation project;voluntary purchase program;periphery irrigation project ### Topics keywords: short term;factor affecting;extension service ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1998,,Review of Agricultural Economics,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2307/1349546,,#37437,,"",""
Reappraisal of the climate change challenge in the Congo Basin and implications for the cost of adaptation.,"","Abstract: The consensus on the reality of climate change is unequivocal. With the IPCC projecting that global greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 25-90% between the years 2000 and 2030, further warming and induced changes in the global climate system shall impact on many physical and biological systems. The Congo Basin countries are already experiencing climate change. Some local and regional studies have identified increasing temperatures, increasing wetness, significant variations in inter-seasonal and intra-seasonal climate, increase in floods and threats of landslides. Less sophisticated climate models have shown that Congo Basin countries will experience increases in rainfall of around 7.3% by 2050 and 13.5% by 2100. More sophisticated models predict significant increases in average annual precipitation up to 200 mm in the eastern portion of the Basin. The temperature change predictions between 2010 and 2050 consistently show that temperatures could rise by 1-3°C. Congo Basin countries' vulnerability to climate change is owed to their geographical location, reliance on resources sensitive to climate and the low adaptive capacity of firms, households and the states. The most vulnerable people in the subregion are the urban poor and small-scale farmers. The most vulnerable sectors are agriculture, health, energy, coastal zones and water resources. Possibly the forests could be severely affected in the long run. There is need for urgent action. Tasks and activities will encompass managing natural resources, better resource management, and changes in laws, programmes, policies and investments. A potential national adaptation investment strategy for the Congo Basin countries will overlap with traditional development concerns and provide an opportunity to increase efficiency of the developmental efforts. New and additional financial resources shall be required to supplement current development plans, to ensure they are resilient to climate effects. This additional resource is the price for or cost of adaptation. ### Countries mentioned: Congo;Congo ### Measurements for interventions: greenhouse gas;gas emission;greenhouse gas emission ### Topics keywords: natural resource;IPCC;adaptive capacity;GHG emission;environmental impact;N2O;GHG;small scale;natural resource management;greenhouse gas;social capital;short term;cover crop;climate change;long run;factor influencing;CH4;extension service;small scale farmer;CC;greenhouse gas emission ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;BLEND",2015,,Environment and Natural Resources Research,,,,,,,#37068,,"",""
Recent developments in sugar cane growing in Mauritius.,"","Abstract: Sugarcane occupies more than 90% of the farmland in Mauritius. Production, which reaches 700 000 t of sugar in good years, is from time to time affected by drought and especially by hurricanes; sugar retains a high position in the exports of the country. The sugar industry remains in the hands of a small group of miller-planters, the majority of whom are French Mauritians. In spite of the industrial-style management of recent years, the sugar mills are of medium size; the average annual production per mill is about 35 000 t. These companies obtain cane not only from the large planters but also from the 35 000 small farmers, of Indian origin, most of whom are owners, with some being sharecroppers. The quality of the Mauritian soil demands considerable work, especially for stone cleaning and at harvest time. In the lower areas which are protected from the trade winds, irrigation is essential. Agricultural output is satisfactory, the mills are operated economically and the Mauritians obtain 8-9 t of sugar per ha. Total output will rise o further, and the population, which is steadily increasing, must find other work outlets. Agricultural diversification remains insufficient, but the owners of the sugar companies have themselves contributed towards the development of new activities such as tourism and industries that have benefited from the free trading zone system. ### Countries mentioned: Mauritius;Mauritania;India ### Plant products search: sugarcane ### Measurements for interventions: cane ### Topics keywords: sugar beet;sugar industry;sweet potato;sugar cane;raw material ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD",1989,,Cahiers d'Outre-Mer,,,,,,,#37300,,"",""
Reconciling household goals in southern African woodlands using weighted goal programming.,"","Abstract: Weighted goal programming (WGP) is employed to reconcile the goals of food security, improved incomes and woodland conservation in households from selected sites in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In Mozambique, the study sites were located in districts rich in miombo woodlands that support rural communities and adjacent towns with industrial timber and non-industrial forest products. The rural households had, on the average, six members and were largely involved in subsistence agriculture. Some households were also engaged in livestock rearing and sale of forest products, mainly charcoal. In Malawi, the study was conducted on households bordering three forest reserves. They were largely involved in subsistence agriculture, livestock rearing and trade in firewood and charcoal from the forest. In Zimbabwe, the study sites were in Chivi and Gokwe districts. Gokwe district has better agricultural potential and forest cover. Chivi district receives less rainfall and is therefore a poor agroecological area. The three goals are attainable simultaneously, albeit with trade-offs useful in guiding development of rural development policies. The WGP model provides a framework for evaluating impact, on the household goals and woodland condition, of some macroeconomic and sectoral policies and demographic changes. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe;Mozambique;Malawi ### Topics keywords: trade offs;land use change;ecosystem service;land cover;rural community;rural household;environmental impact;forest cover;protected area;rural development;crop residue;food security ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND;IDA",2005,,International Forestry Review,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1505/ifor.2005.7.4.294,,#37026,,"",""

"Role of institutional innovations on smallholder agricultural entrepreneurship in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.","","Abstract: Smallholder farmers in South Africa are regarded as resource constrained and dogged by a wide range of challenges including weak or absence of vibrant support institutions at local level. However, smallholder farmers still fulfil numerous functions in the agricultural economy, which include food security and income generation. The main objective of the study was to explore the role of both formal and informal arrangements as forms of institutional innovations at smallholder farm level. It was found that, due to weak formal institutions, farmers in KwaZulu-Natal resort to self-regulated institutions to ensure timely access to farming services. Informal groupings are common among irrigators, which have become important means of accessing inputs such as seedlings, irrigation plots and machinery for land preparation as well as output markets. Farmers were selective and participated in some group activities and not in others; hence training farmers should focus on team building activities to ensure consistency and derive maximum benefits from collective action. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil;South Africa ### Topics keywords: drought stress;SA;human health;collective action;pest control;smallholder farmer;social capital;wide range;food security ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2016,,Journal of Human Ecology,,,,,,,#37452,,"",""
Roots of famine in Sudan's killing fields.,"","Abstract: The causes of famine in Sudan and historical events that have led to the present turbulent situation in the country are discussed with reference to war, militia activity, agricultural policies, and World Bank/IMF policies. The historical nature of the animosity between the principally Muslim north, and the extensively Christian south of Sudan is examined. The emergence of the militias in the south have massively aggravated the agricultural crisis brought about by unreliable rainfall. Smallholder farmers and pastoralists have developed ways over many years to cope with and survive periods of drought and instability though agriculture and livestock practices aimed at minimizing risks rather than maximizing returns. However these community based mechanisms have been eroded by years of conflict and government policy which discriminates against them. The need for international diplomatic initiatives to end the violence in Sudan which has prevented any real advances to be made through the many aid programmes which have been initiated by donor agencies is highlighted. ### Countries mentioned: Sudan;South Sudan ### Topics keywords: contract farming;smallholder farmer;factor influencing ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",1995,,Disaster and development in the Horn of Africa.,,,,,,,#37052,,"",""
Rural development - a blind alley.,"","Abstract: In the 1970s the emphasis has moved from production oriented general agricultural development projects which tended to give most help to better off and more efficient peasant farmers. Instead the emphasis is on regionally based rural development projects aimed at the poorest 40 per cent. of the population, and aimed at improving social conditions (drinking water, clinics, schools) as well as improving incomes by production oriented local programmes. The danger is that shortage of food and raw materials as well as the cost of such schemes will again mean that even such local projects must stress their production aspects and allow welfare considerations to take second place. ### Programs found: local project;rural development (RD) project;agriculture development project (ADPJ);development project;local program;production oriented local program;agricultural development project (ADP);rural development project (RDP) ### Measurements for interventions: rural development ### Topics keywords: rural development;drinking water;raw material",1975,,Zeitschrift fur Auslandische Landwirtschaft,,,,,,,#36709,,"",""
Savings of farmers: a cross-section analysis.,"","Abstract: The concept of residual savings is not very realistic; saving should rather be considered as the result of deliberate action. This observation, valid for the majority of households, is even more relevant for farmers and, generally, for entrepreneurs who allocate an important share of their income to savings. For this reason the financial behaviour of farmers should be examined in relation to savings rather than to consumption. This article presents some results derived from studies based on French and Swiss farm accounts which included both the household and the farming business. The results indicate that: (a) the incidence of saving depends essentially on the level of income, with non-farm income exerting a marked influence on small farms; (b) the incidence of saving is more directly related to gross income than to net income after depreciation; ### Countries mentioned: France;Swaziland ### Topics keywords: net income;rural household;economic benefit;net return ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1976,,European Review of Agricultural Economics,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/erae/3.4.501,,#37447,,"",""
Seasonal and sex variation in physical activity levels among agro-pastoralists in Nepal,"","Abstract: Considerable attention has been devoted to variation in levels of energy expenditure between and within populations; these are commonly evaluated following international guidelines for grading light, moderate, and heavy physical activity levels (PAL). This study presents activity profiles by season and sex for subsistence agro-pastoralists in Nepal, comparing data for a sample of 20 men observed four times across the year with previously published data on women. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was estimated from direct minute-by-minute observation (totaling 1,679 h for men, 3,601 h for women) and measures of the energy cost of single tasks (117 for men, 168 for women). PAL were calculated and graded as multiples of predicted basal metabolic rate (BMR). Despite an explicitly egalitarian organization of labor, men achieved higher PAL than women (P<.0001), although according to international gradings, both men and women assume moderately heavy PAL in the winter and very heavy PAL in the monsoon. PAL were 1.88 and 2.22 x BMR for men in respective seasons (P<.005; TEE, 11.8 MJ/d and 13.9 MJ/d) and 1.77 and 2.0 x BMR for women (TEE, 9.1 MJ/d and 10.5 MJ/d). High TEE values result from time-consuming work in subsistence tasks, most of which are of moderate energy cost. Results show that the international guideline (FAO/WHO/UNU [1985]) for grading levels of energy expenditure, which adopts discrepant sex-specific values to define thresholds for moderate or heavy PAL, can mask significant gender variation. Male/female ratios of PAL values are suggested instead for population-level comparisons. ### Countries mentioned: Nepal ### Topics keywords: chemical fertilizer;use efficiency;energy consumption;MJ;FAO ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",1996,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199605)100:1<7::AID-AJPA2>3.0.CO;2-Y,,#36993,,"",""
Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change and advance food security,"","Abstract: World soils have been a source of atmospheric carbon dioxide since the dawn of settled agriculture, which began about 10 millennia ago. Most agricultural soils have lost 30% to 75% of their antecedent soil organic carbon (SOC) pool or 30 to 40 t C ha. The magnitude of loss is often more in soils prone to accelerated erosion and other degradative processes. On a global scale, CO2-C emissions since 1850 are estimated at 270 ± 30 giga ton (billion ton or Gt) from fossil fuel combustion compared with 78 ± 12 Gt from soils. Consequently, the SOC pool in agricultural soils is much lower than their potential capacity. Furthermore, depletion of the SOC pool also leads to degradation in soil quality and declining agronomic/biomass productivity. Therefore, conversion to restorative land uses (e.g., afforestation, improved pastures) and adoption of recommended management practices (RMP) can enhance SOC and improve soil quality. Important RMP for enhancing SOC include conservation tillage, mulch farming, cover crops, integrated nutrient management including use of manure and compost, and agroforestry. Restoration of degraded/desertified soils and ecosystems is an important strategy. The rate of SOC sequestration, ranging from 100 to 1000 kg ha year, depends on climate, soil type, and site-specific management. Total potential of SOC sequestration in the United States of 144 to 432 Mt year (288 Mt year) comprises 45 to 98 Mt in cropland, 13 to 70 Mt in grazing land, and 25 to 102 Mt in forestland. The global potential of SOC sequestration is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Gt C year, comprising 0.4 to 0.8 Gt C year through adoption of RMP on cropland (1350 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.03 Gt C year on irrigated soils (275 Mha), and 0.01 to 0.3 Gt C year through improvements of rangelands and grasslands (3700 Mha). In addition, there is a large potential of C sequestration in biomass in forest plantations, short rotation woody perennials, and so on. The attendant improvement in soil quality with increase in SOC pool size has a strong positive impact on agronomic productivity and world food security. An increase in the SOC pool within the root zone by 1 t C ha year can enhance food production in developing countries by 30 to 50 Mt year including 24 to 40 Mt year of cereal and legumes, and 6 to 10 Mt year of roots and tubers. Despite the enormous challenge of SOC sequestration, especially in regions of warm and arid climates and predominantly resource-poor farmers, it is a truly a win-win strategy. While improving ecosystem services and ensuring sustainable use of soil resources, SOC sequestration also mitigates global warming by offsetting fossil fuel emissions and improving water quality by reducing nonpoint source pollution. ### Countries mentioned: United States ### Plant products search: legumes;tuber;cereals ### Measurements for interventions: SOC sequestration;organic carbon ### Topics keywords: site specific;EC;soil fertility;carbon sequestration;atmospheric carbon dioxide;DOC;CC;NPK;GHG emission;bulk density;developing country;environmental impact;source pollution;drip irrigation;agroforestry system;root zone;NT;raw material;paddy field;precision agriculture;integrated nutrient;conservation tillage;LCA;carbon dioxide;soil organic carbon;OC;energy consumption;CO2;TP;management practice;food security;biogas production;ecosystem service;cover crop;climate change;fossil fuel;soil moisture;organic carbon;FYM;CH4;crop residue;CT;global warming ### Geo regions: North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2007,,Soil Science,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/ss.0b013e31815cc498,,#37289,,"",""

Saudi agricultural policy from a rural and regional perspective,"","Abstract: Among other objectives of the Saudi agricultural policy, extending from the late 1970's to the present, was establishment of necessary conditions for development in rural and remote regions. It was expected that agricultural development in those areas would help utilize previously unemployed resources, diversify the economic base, promote social attitudes toward work, and establish methods for better personal and regional income distribution. The Saudi experience in agricultural development interests those who are concerned with agricultural development in arid and desert areas without inland rivers, limited non-renewable underground water reserves, and a population most of which regards farming peasantry as a lowly occupation. This study explores the success of this policy, especially achievement of the rural and regional goals. Some socio-economic indicators are implemented within an ""economic base"" theoretical framework to obtain conclusions about impact of the policy at various levels. Research revealed that the Saudi agricultural policy succeeded in establishing a resource-based, large-scale, capital intensive, project-based, commercialized farming sector. The policy achieved most of its quantified objectives such as increasing agricultural production and achieving self-sufficiency in selected crops, such as irrigated wheat. Social costs of agricultural development were very high, especially in water use for irrigation. At the regional level, the policy succeeded in establishing farming in areas close to major regional growth centers, especially in the central and northern regions. At the rural level, by concentration on large-scale farming, the policy disregarded agricultural activities of the subsistence sector such as traditional fishing and livestock breeding by Bedouin tribes. In general, the policy requires the following adjustments to serve a wider range of regional and rural objectives: (1) A shift from large scale project-based agriculture to small scale family-based agriculture. In this context priority should be given to agricultural activities of people living in subsistence sectors. (2) Some mechanism should be established to correlate regional production strategies and financial support policies with regional demand rather than to national or foreign demand. (3) Crop selection should be concerned with water requirements to optimize use of the limited nonrenewable water resources and to minimize social and environmental costs. ### Countries mentioned: Saudi Arabia ### Plant products search: wheat ### Programs found: large scale (LIS) project;scale project;small scale project;intensive project ### Topics keywords: small scale;CAP;human health;self sufficiency;financial support;large scale;attitude towards;pest control;factor affecting;wide range;food security ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1990,,,,,,,http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/303905611?accountid=9783,,#36215,,"",""
Savanna town: rural ties and urban opportunities in Northern Kenya.,"","Abstract: This is a study of a small multi-ethnic town in northern Kenya, its rural ""umland"" and the interdependence between the two. The town, Isiolo, is an administrative and trade centre, strategically located between farming and pastoral areas. Around the town and to the north live pastoralists who subsist on either camel or cattle herding (depending primarily on pasture quality) and on flocks of sheep and goats. Rainfall is highly irregular which means that the annual average is a poor measure of the region's productive capacity. Included in the Isiolo umland are also the northern slopes of Nyambeni Hills, a mountain range with fertile soil, good rains and high agricultural output. Isiolo town and its umland are interdependent in many respects. The major aim of this study is to present an understanding of the qualities of the various ties. Three introductory chapters depict the emergence of the small town and touch upon the reasons for its existence. The second part of the study, which takes the form of one concluding discussion, involves the umland, partly in order to make it possible to account for the varying roles of the township in total household strategies to maintain domestic viability.

"Seasonal dry matter production of <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Lotus corniculatus</i> in a dryland commercial sheep pastoral system.","","Abstract: (Birdsfoot trefoil, 'Grassland Goldie') may have a role in dryland pastoral systems in New Zealand, but there is little information available on its production under sheep grazing in these conditions. Dry matter (DM) production of was measured monthly for 2 consecutive years in a systems approach experiment comparing it with perennial ryegrass /white clover pasture in the Wairarapa on the east coast of the North Island. The total DM produced for 2 years was 8.5 and 10.5 t/ha for compared with 7.3 and 9.9 t/ha for pasture. Also, the moderate concentration of CT (18-29 g/kg DM) in has been shown to increase sheep productivity (Wang 1996ab; Min 1999, 2001). This production advantage, combined with improved sheep performance, supports the potential use of as a specialist forage in dryland areas. ### Countries mentioned: New Zealand ### Plant products search: cloves;clover ### Measurements for interventions: CT;pasture ### Topics keywords: ecosystem service;crop rotation;DM;CA;decision maker;conservation tillage;conventional tillage;soil organic carbon;carbon storage;decision making;crop residue;dry matter;CT;NT ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2003,,"Legumes for dryland pastures.

"Sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen in channelised surface run-off from a New Zealand pastoral catchment.","","Abstract: Surface run-off derived from 94 m (20°) and 230 m (15°) long hillsopes in a pastoral cathcment was collected along a 15.8 m total intercepting face. Surface run-off occurred on 49 occasions, these events ranging from 0.2 to 115 m. About 50% of the total run-off occurred in six events. In 20 months the eight individual 1.5-2.4 m long collectors intercepted 4-333 m of water. This uneven spatial run-off pattern, the measured flow rates, and total event volumes indicated that extensive areas on both hillsopes produced run-off, and that extreme channelisation occurred during movement downslope. Mean flow weighted run-off concentrations were for total phosphorus (TP) 1053 mg/m, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) 300 mg/m, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) 5898 mg/m, dissolved Kjeldahl nitrogen (DKN) 1413 mg/m, NO-N 69 mg/m, suspended sediments (SS) 472 g/m, and volatile suspended sediment (VSS) 115 g/m. Estimated catchment surface run-off yields in 1984 were: TP 0.75 kg/ha. TDP 0.15 kg/ha, TKN 4.43 kg/ha, DKN 0.74 kg/ha, NO-N 0.03 kg/ha, SS 374 kg/ha, and VSS 90 kg/ha.

"Settlement in the Eastern Kimberleys, Western Australia.","","Abstract: This is an account of the various land types which occur within a distinct natural region that has been developed almost entirely for the cattle industry. The region is situated roughly between latitudes 15° and 18°30' S. and embraces the major valleys of the Ord and Victoria rivers and their tributaries. Eleven land types are recognized including the following: flat areas of savannah woodland and grassland which form some of the best pastoral country and are suitable for irrigation; long-gentle limestone slopes with light soils highly susceptible to wind and water erosion; hilly upland pastures; and alluvial areas forming ex- cellent well-watered pastures. This general description is followed by a detailed examination of the landscape of the Ord River valley which lies within Western Australia. It includes steep ranges with spp. dominant, upper and lower gentle slopes where and sp. make phenomenally rapid growth during the wet season, and the valley floor occupied by clay plains. The plains have been closely grazed and the composition of the present pastures includes spp., , and the less desirable spp. and sp. So far no legume has been successfully introduced into the pastures of northern Australia, which consequently remain lacking in protein and rather low in carrying capacity. A description aided by statistics of the climate of the Eastern Kimberleys is followed by an historical and economic account of the cattle industry. Limiting factors in the future development of the industry are the dry season linked with a period of semi-starvation in October, lack of sufficient watering places, fencing, roads and transport, but successful results have been achieved with introduced pasture grasses adapted to the area.-M.E.E. ### Countries mentioned: Australia;United States ### Plant products search: legumes ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;North America ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",1945,,Australian Geographer,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/00049184508702244,,#36926,,"",""
Sheepmeat flavor and the effect of different feeding systems: a review.,"","Abstract: Lamb has a unique flavor, distinct from other popular red meats. Although flavor underpins lamb's popularity, it can also be an impediment to consumer acceptance. Lack of familiarity with sheepmeat flavor itself can be a barrier for some consumers, and undesirable feed-induced flavors may also compromise acceptability. Against the backdrop of climate uncertainty and unpredictable rainfall patterns, sheep producers are turning to alternatives to traditional grazing pasture systems. Historically, pasture has been the predominant feed system for lamb production in Australia and around the world. It is for this reason that there has been a focus on ""pastoral"" flavor in sheep meat. Pasture-associated flavors may be accepted as ""normal"" by consumers accustomed to meat from pasture-fed sheep; however, these flavors may be unfamiliar to consumers of meat produced from grain-fed and other feed systems. Over the past few decades, studies examining the impacts of different feeds on lamb meat quality have yielded variable consumer responses ranging from ""no effect"" to ""unacceptable"", illustrating the diverse and sometimes inconsistent impacts of different forages on sheepmeat flavor. Despite considerable research, there is no consensus on which volatiles are essential for desirable lamb aroma and how they differ compared to other red meats, for example, beef. In contrast, comparatively little work has focused specifically on the nonvolatile taste components of lamb flavor. Diet also affects the amount of intramuscular fat and its fatty acid composition in the meat, which has a direct effect on meat juiciness and texture as well as flavor, and its release during eating. The effect of diet is far from simple and much still needs to be learned. An integrated approach that encompasses all input variables is required to better understand the impact of the feed and related systems on sheepmeat flavor. This review brings together recent research findings and proposes some novel approaches to gain insights into the relationship between animal diet, genetics, and sheepmeat quality. ### Countries mentioned: Australia ### Plant products search: grain ### Animal products search: sheep meat;beef;lamb meat ### Topics keywords: human health;fatty acid;beef cattle;chemical composition ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2013,,Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/jf303768e,,#37050,,"",""

"Small cardamom - Precious for people, harmful for mountain forests","","Abstract: Small cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) is a valuable source of income for numerous resource-poor farmers inhabiting the East Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. Notwithstanding, the primary forests in these mountains also have the highest ratio of endemic flora and fauna per 100 km(2) of all biodiversity hotspots in the world. Cardamom cultivation, under current growing practices, is radically changing the composition of the forest, thus threatening the endemic species within the forest. A comparative analysis of cardamom-growing practices, problems, and opportunities in the traditional cardamom-producing country, India, and in the world's largest cardamom producer, Guatemala, showed that deterioration is a common denominator. On-farm research, conducted as a complement to the project, demonstrated that organic cardamom could be profitably grown in homegardens. By implementing agroforestry systems, the harmful impact of cardamom cultivation on the forests might be dramatically reduced. ### Countries mentioned: India;Guatemala;Tanzania ### Plant products search: cardamoms ### Programs found: complement project;complementary project ### Topics keywords: comparative analysis;taking account;protected area;agroforestry system;AFS ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Sub-Saharan Africa;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055)",2006,,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2006)26[131:SCFPHF]2.0.CO;2,,#37161,,"",""
Social and economic impacts and management of shrimp disease among small-scale farmers in Thailand and Viet Nam.,"","Abstract: Shrimp farming in Thailand is dominated by small-scale farms, which make up around 80% of the total number. Whilst shrimp aquaculture has contributed to income generation among coastal communities, disease outbreaks have caused significant economic losses to farmers and the country in recent years. Outbreaks of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and yellowhead virus, as well as bacterial diseases which struck later in 1997, led to the overall shrimp production of Thailand being reduced by 30% (from 210 000-150 000 mt). These diseases had a serious impact on all farmers, especially small-scale farmers whose main income was derived from shrimp farming. Moreover, at least 60% of small-scale farmers are thought to have become indebted to banks due to production lost as a result of shrimp disease. This paper discusses some of the impacts of disease outbreaks on small-scale farmers and reviews the strategies adopted by farmers to manage risks associated with shrimp disease. The shrimp farming situation in Vietnam is very different from that in Thailand, as shrimp farming is mainly low input and extensive. Shrimp farming also provides an important source of income in some coastal areas and has potential to contribute to poverty alleviation among coastal communities. A project supported by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research looked at the impacts and management of shrimp disease problems among extensive farms in Ca Mau Province of the Mekong Delta, as part of a project for improving the social and economic returns to farmers from ""mixed shrimp-mangrove"" farming systems. The households in the project area were primarily dependent on aquaculture and capture fishery as the main source of family income, the majority being dependent primarily on shrimp aquaculture. The average household income in 1996 was 12.08 million Dong/household/yr, equivalent to around US$1000 at 1998 exchange rates, or 2.4 million Dong/person/yr (US$170/caput/yr). Poverty thresholds as quoted by the United Nations Development Programme in 1995 were around 1.1 million Dong/person/yr. An estimated 40% of households were below this threshold, showing a significant poverty problem in the area. Shrimp culture provides an opportunity to improve incomes and contributes to poverty alleviation, although effective management to reduce risks associated with disease outbreaks is required. Disease outbreaks severely affected shrimp yields in the Mekong Delta area from 1996, leading to negative social and economic impacts on farm households, including reduced incomes and increased debt. In 1997, mass mortalities occurred four times (in January, June, July and October), and were associated with high prevalence of WSSV and adverse environmental conditions associated with poor water and soil quality. The disease problem was also compounded by the low educational level of most farmers, farmer inexperience with aquaculture, and lack of access to technical advice and to capital to invest in farm improvements and risk-reduction measures. The implementation of technical recommendations for reducing disease risk is closely interlinked with educational, institutional, social and economic conditions. In particular, better educational opportunities, more flexible and accessible credit arrangements, and greater access to regular technical support are key factors in determining the willingness and capacity of farmers to implement farm-level risk management strategies. In view of the lack of technical support in the area, much closer cooperation among farmers, building on existing farm groups, is also important to promote effective self-help and extension of support. ### Countries mentioned: Viet Nam;Australia;Thailand ### Programs found: community project (CP);household project;national development program;development program;united nation development program (UNDP) ### Topics keywords: small scale;short term;united nation;poverty alleviation;rural household;exchange rate;factor influencing;household income;rural development;extension service;FAO;small scale farmer;farming system;food security ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2002,,FAO Fisheries Technical Paper,,,,,,,#37007,,"",""

Soil erosion. The problem in South Australia and what is being done about it.,"","Abstract: Correction of the national problem of soil erosion must be made by the individual Australian farmer. Fallow-wheat rotations are no longer economic, and serious overstocking as a result of early legislation is now being remedied. Regeneration of pastoral areas is difficult and in these and the mallee areas of South Australia detailed survey is lacking. Cereal rye is outstanding for the temporary protection of sand drifts, and 40 lb. per acre with 0.5 cwt. of superphosphate is recommended. Lucerne can be established in the rye stubble where the annual rainfall is more than 14 inches, while can stabilize sand drifts under only 10 inches annual rainfall. The most productive lands in the south-east show differential water erosion in cultivated and grazing areas. Of the arable land, 69 per cent has lost between 0.25 and 0.75 of the original surface soil, while the forest and grazing land shows a similar loss on only 7 per cent of its extent.

Soil nutrient depletion and repletion in a tropical agroecosystem,"","Abstract: Soil nutrient depletion is one of the most serious threats to sustainable crop production in African agroecosystems where policy and economic factors have favoured extensification rather than intensification of agriculture. Initially, we assessed the relationship of household land use and socio economic factors on the soil fertility of over 2000 fields on 236 smallholder farms in the eastern and western highlands of Kenya. In the western highlands, soil organic matter was higher in pastures than other land uses, while the opposite was the case in the eastern highlands. Number of cattle per farm was not related to soil fertility in either region. In the highlands of western Kenya, maize productivity across a cultivation chronosequence, which ranged from recent conversion from primary forest to 100 years in continuous cropping, declined rapidly as cultivation age increased from 3 to 25 years, and then gradually declined to a yield of 1.6 Mg ha -1 season-1. Long rainy season grain yield in the oldest conversions was only 24% of the young conversion grain yield (6.4 Mg ha -1). Soil pools of mineral nitrogen (N), strongly bound phosphorus (P) and plant available P decreased by 82, 31 and 36% and P adsorption capacity increased by 51% after 100 years of continuous cultivation. There was a greater yield increment response to urea N and triple super phosphate when applied together (ranging from 1 to 3.8 Mg ha-1 season-1) than when either fertilizer was applied alone, with the greatest responses on the oldest conversions. Tithonia diversifolia leaves or cow manure were applied at an equivalent rate of 25 kg P ha-1. With manure, additional N was needed to sustain yield as time under cultivation increased, but not with T. diversifolia. Application of N and P together resulted in higher benefit to cost ratios (BCRs) on all conversions, with the greatest BCRs on the oldest conversions, suggesting that soil nutrient replenishment strategies should include both nutrients and consider time under cultivation. Despite BCR's >1 and positive net benefits of N and P fertilizer application, efforts to overcome nutrient depletion in these systems may be hampered by the high cost of fertilizer relative to the average income of farmers in this region. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Papua New Guinea ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: adsorption;cow manure;manure;phosphorus ### Topics keywords: soil fertility;agro ecosystem;net return;point view;NH4;rice straw;NO3;pest control;long term;VI;DM;cost ratio;organic matter;management practice;SOM;OM;land use;adsorption capacity;sustainable agriculture;grain yield ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2008,,,,,,,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304628735?accountid=10267,,#36360,,"",""
Understanding smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate change in a coastal community in Central Vietnam,"","Abstract: Climate change as expressed by erratic rainfall, increased flooding, extended droughts, frequency tropical cyclones or saline water intrusion, poses severe threats to smallholder farmers in Vietnam. Adaptation of the agricultural sector is vital to increase the resilience of smallholder farmers' livelihoods in times of climate change. To complement efforts already implemented by farmers to reduce social vulnerability it is important to understand how farmers perceive their current and future capacity to adapt to climate change. This paper aims to explore smallholder farmers' capacity to respond to climate change in current and future agricultural production. We carried out open, in-depth interviews (n=13), focus group discussions, and structured interviews (n=114) in the Thua Thien Hue province. Our findings show that farmers nowadays experience more extreme climate variability. Farmers report increasing stresses due to temperature increase and droughts. The autonomous adaptation strategies adopted by farmers include; adjusting the season calendar, using tolerant varieties and breeds, applying integrated crop production models, and income diversification. The motives for adopting particular planned adaptation options differ between farmers in crop production and livestock production. Four factors were found to be significant (p<.05) in influencing the spread of adaptation measures (AMs) farmers adopted: farm income, the number of available information sources, number of workers on the farm, and farmable land available during the summer season. Farmers report several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including; market price fluctuations, lack of skilled labour, lack of climate change information, and lack of capacity to learn and apply techniques in their daily practice. While both crop and livestock farmers participated in one or several training courses on climate change in the past years, livestock farmers were still uncertain about their future capacity and possible AMs. ### Countries mentioned: Viet Nam ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;adaptation strategy;growing season;adaptation measure;climate variability;smallholder farmer;human activity;CC;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2018,,CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2017.1411240,,#36768,,"",""
"Trees outside forests: Agro-, community, and urban forestry","","Abstract: Planted forests are often considered to consist of tree plantings at a scale large enough to satisfy such objectives as commercial production of timber and fiber, protection of watersheds, and preservation of natural habitats. However, trees are planted also at greatly reduced scales in agroforestry systems or as community woodlots to provide a mixture of products and services to resident households, local communities, and regional cultures. Agroforestry systems represent a major form of small-scale tree planting, where trees are grown in purposeful combinations with agricultural crops and/or livestock in order to take advantage of tree-crop interactions, and thereby enhance crop production, diversify farm output, stabilize or improve soils, or ameliorate harsh environmental conditions. Some important examples of these systems in tropical countries include homegardens, alley cropping, improved fallows, intercropped trees for shade and fodder production, and trees planted in hedgerows and along fence lines. Throughout the tropics, there is a large variety of indigenous practices and species mixtures that represent adaptations of these systems to meet localized needs and opportunities. Research and development programs have supported the expansion and refinement of many of these systems during the last 20 years, but substantial constraints on tree planting still exist in the form of land-tenure practices, population pressures that relegate agroforestry practices to degraded lands, subsistence needs that prevent extended periods of tree growth, and insufficient technical information or technology dissemination. Agroforestry systems in temperate, industrialized countries include combinations of trees, pasture, and livestock; fruit or nut trees interplanted with vegetable or grain crops; windbreaks and shelterbelts; multispecies riparian buffer strips; and forest farming systems for specialty crops. Compared to the tropics, however, temperate-zone systems tend to focus on one or two high-value crops, often involve some level of mechanization, and frequently represent an opportunistic approach to improving the economic profitability of farms rather than meeting subsistence needs. In both tropical and temperate regions, agroforestry systems and community woodlots will be an important component of new sustainable agriculture and environmental protection programs. Although species diversity is an essential feature of all agroforestry systems, community forests generally involve planting only a few species in small woodlots near farms, around villages, along roads, and as riparian buffers. Provincial or state governments and the local populace are often involved in landownership and plantation establishment. Major objectives of these forests are production of fuelwood for local consumption and of other tree products for market; soil stabilization, reclamation, or improvement; and protection of water quality. As with many other planted forests, the number of species widely used in community forests has been relatively small, with the genera Eucalyptus, Pinus, and Acacia providing the bulk of the species. Major issues with these 'planted forests' focus on rights for use of the products, tending responsibilities once trees are established, protection until trees are large enough for their designated use, increasing interest in using 'native' species, and greater community involvement in planning and management. Trees planted along streets and waterways, or as woodlots in parks and other public places, represent a major group of planted forests in many urban and periurban landscapes. In addition to providing many of the same environmental services that agroforests and community forests do, these urban plantings have unique aesthetic and recreational value. For much of the world's ever-increasing urban population, these may be the only tangible reference points for understanding planted forests. These relatively little-recognized forms of planted forests - planted trees, to be more appropriate - are now receiving much greater attention. There are, however, some serious technical and sociopolitico-institutional constraints to their development as more widely adopted systems in both tropical and temperate regions. ### Plant products search: nuts;grain;fruits;vegetables ### Programs found: development program;protection program;environmental protection (EP) program;research development (R4D) program ### Topics keywords: animal welfare;natural resource;drought stress;land degradation;SA;rural community;environmental impact;agroforestry system;large scale;farming system;agroforestry practice;small scale;land reform;environmental protection;rural tourism;protected area;degraded land;land tenure;social capital;animal husbandry;local community;sustainable development;land ownership;AFS;sustainable agriculture",1999,,New Forests,,,,,,,#36716,,"",""
The use of wetlands for small-scale agricultural production in Swaziland,"","Abstract: There are three types of wetlands in Swaziland namely, riverine, lacustrine and palustrine systems. The riverine and palustrine systems provide important grazing resources and are used for crop production by smallholder farmers. Growing of subsistence crops on individual basis in some of the wetlands of Swaziland is an old practice, however organised commercial cropping of wetlands by smallholder farmers is a recent development in the use of wetlands. It has been observed that smallholder farmers who organise themselves into groups or cooperatives are able to use wetland resources for some degree of commercial agriculture without undermining the ecological balance of these ecosystems. The main threats to crop production in wetland areas of Swaziland include crop damage by livestock and limited water during dry periods. These threats can be overcome by fencing in crop areas and installing irrigation and water supply infrastructure to ensure sufficient supplies of water for year round cropping. The study shows that those farmers who form cohesive garden groups are more successful in their utilisation of wetlands for agriculture than those that continue to use the wetlands on an individual basis. The sustainable use of wetlands for agriculture can be enhanced by ensuring that the farmers receive expert advise on how best they can expand their agricultural production with minimum damage to the wetland resources and by ensuring that there are adequate legal and policy instruments guiding the use of wetlands for agricultural purposes in the country. Most of the existing national policies and laws are biased towards conservation and protection. However, the local bylaws engraved in the Swazi culture and customs provide a basis for effective legal and institutional frameworks for promoting the sustainable use of wetlands for agriculture. Thus, strengthening the existing local byelaws can go a long way towards achieving this goal. ### Countries mentioned: Swaziland ### Topics keywords: small scale;smallholder farmer;rural household ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2003,,International Journal of Ecology and Environmental Sciences,,,,,,,#37535,,"",""
"Vulnerabilities, competition and rights in a context of climate change toward equitable water governance in Peru's Rio Santa Valley","","Abstract: As glacial retreat changes the hydrology of Peru's Rio Santa, water demand is growing, pollution is worsening, and competition for water among economic sectors, political jurisdictions and upstream and downstream water users is intensifying. The vulnerability of highland communities, food producers, and poor urban neighborhoods in the Santa watershed in the face of these changes is magnified by inequities in water governance, giving rise to water conflict. Peru's new water regime defines water as an economic good and seeks to centralize control over water. This article analyzes implications of this regime for ensuring equity and managing conflict. It concludes that Peru's water regime is more likely to address equity issues when faced with concerted citizen action. ### Countries mentioned: Peru ### Topics keywords: natural resource;cover crop;climate change;CC ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2012,,Global Environmental Change,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.02.002,,#37027,,"",""
Village beef cattle production: an approach in Western Samoa.,"","Abstract: The primary goal of village beef production in Western Samoa is seen as the replacement of beef imports at or below import cost, with the ultimate objective of establishing a large, self-sustaining smallholder herd. The establishment of a 100 acre project is explained. Land sites, fences, subdivision of property, cattle yards, pastures, water supply, and breeds of livestock are described and management strategies are discussed. The establishment costs of a typical project are detailed and data on development and running costs and gross returns are provided. ### Countries mentioned: Samoa ### Animal products search: beef ### Programs found: acre project ### Topics keywords: gross return;beef cattle;net return;ICT ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IDA",1978,,"Report Series, Department of Agriculture and Forests, Government of Western Samoa",,,,,,,#36855,,"",""
Water buffaloes in Brazil: a neglected opportunity for rural development.,"","Abstract: The water buffalo, a flexible, often underestimated farm animal in the tropics and subtropics, was introduced into Brazil almost 100 years ago. The humid Amazonian region offered the water buffalo, which thrives in semi-aquatic conditions, an ideal habitat. More than half of the water buffalo population, estimated at 700 000 to 800 000, are concentrated in East Amazonia. Large increases in the population and performance parameters point to a promising potential. The predominant form of buffalo farming at present corresponds to the traditional extensive grazing husbandry practised with cattle in Brazil and does not make full use of the flexibility of the buffalo as a source of milk and meat, and as a draught animal. Intensive, smallholder agriculture with integrated animal husbandry is better suited to make use of the full potential of the water buffalo and to contribute to developing comparatively favourable and marginally utilized areas, of which the Amazonian flood plain is one. ### Countries mentioned: Brazil ### Animal products search: meat;milk ### Measurements for interventions: water buffalo ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;beef cattle;rural development ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1989,,Entwicklung + Ländlicher Raum,,,,,,,#37312,,Nicola Randall (2019-06-06 20:00:14)(Screen): semi-aquatic farming so not water scarce; ,""
