Input utilization pattern and labour utilization pattern in production of foxtail millet in Bellary district of Karnataka.,"","Abstract: The focus of the present study was on input-use pattern and labour-use pattern in production of foxtail millet in Bellary district of Karnataka. A sample size of 90 farmers was selected using multiple stage random sampling method. Field level data were elicited for the agriculture year 2009-10 through personal interview method. For analyzing the data collected during the study were employed. It was observed that foxtail millet was grown mainly by small and marginal farmers with poor resource base. Foxtail millet growers had a cropping intensity of more than 100 per cent indicating efficient utilization of land. Farmers used lesser quantity of seed than the recommended seed rate for sowing. The quantities of FYM and fertilizers were also found to be less in the production of foxtail millet. Among the different operations, the use of human labour was the highest for harvesting, followed by threshing, interculturing, spreading of farm yard manure, sowing, transportation of farm yard manure, ploughing, harrowing, drying, winnowing and bagging and fertilizer application. The benefit cost ratio of 1.48 indicated its feasibility of cultivation in the rainfed marginal areas. With these results it can be concluded that the cultivation of foxtail millet brings better returns to farmers in rainfed areas. ### Plant products search: millets;foxtail millet ### Measurements for interventions: benefit cost ratio;cost ratio ### Topics keywords: organic fertilizer;net return;use efficiency;farm yard manure;FYM;human labour;cost ratio;farmyard manure",2014,,International Research Journal of Agricultural Economics and Statistics,,,,,,,#36357,,"",Experimental
"Investing in agricultural water management to benefit smallholder farmers in West Bengal, India: AgWater Solutions Project country synthesis report","","Abstract: This Working Paper summarizes research conducted as part of the AgWater Solutions Project in West Bengal between 2009 and 2012. Agriculture is the main livelihood for 70% of West Bengal's population of 91 million. The state's high population density and low per capita landholding make it important for farmers to grow two to three crops a year for survival, hence the critical role of agricultural water management. Researchers from the AgWater Solutions Project conducted studies on rainwater harvesting with small ponds (known locally as hapas), improving access to groundwater through rural electrification and diesel subsidies, and the adoption dynamics of agricultural water management technologies. Research methodologies included rapid rural appraisals, interviews, survey questionnaires and literature reviews. Research suggested that pump rental markets would benefit a large number of poor smallholder farmers. West Bengal has ample groundwater resources, but restrictive policies and high costs make access difficult. Studies on the adoption dynamics of agricultural water management technologies suggested that adoption of irrigation technology does not necessarily follow a linear path from simple manual methods to 'advanced' motorized technologies, and that cost is not necessarily the main driving factor. Rental markets have emerged as a natural response to demand from those who are unable to own a pump. Wider access to groundwater through the use of electric and diesel pumps could benefit anywhere from one to four million households. When farmers are able to access groundwater they cultivate the more high-value boro paddy and diversify their crop mix. Counterproductive policies and rising costs are forcing farmers to cut back on their groundwater use. In areas where groundwater is abundant, easing some of the legal constraints could help to reverse this trend. Rainwater harvesting could benefit from nearly 400,000 to over 600,000 farming households at a 50% adoption rate. The introduction of small rainwater harvesting reservoirs has resulted in benefits, including cultivation of fallow land, higher crop intensity due to cropping in the dry season, new crops, more livestock and aquaculture. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: rice ### Programs found: agwater solution project ### Measurements for interventions: farming household ### Topics keywords: small scale;food insecurity;spatial distribution;biological control;population density;protected area;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2012,,IWMI Working Papers,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5337/2012.210,,#36763,,"",Observational; interventions
Comparative performance of conservation agriculture and current smallholder farming practices in semi-arid Zimbabwe [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Conservation agriculture (CA) is currently promoted in sub-humid and semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa as a means to increase crop water use efficiency and stabilize yields. In this study, conducted during three consecutive seasons in a semi-arid area of Zimbabwe, the short-term performance of CA and current farming practices (CP) were compared in two multi-locational experiments: (1) unfertilised on-farm trials with a cotton-sorghum rotation during three consecutive seasons, and (2) farmers’ cotton fields receiving fertiliser provided on credit by cotton companies during two consecutive seasons. In both cases, residues for mulch were produced in situ. In addition to biophysical measurements, farmers’ perceptions of the technology were appraised. CA did not affect cotton productivity during the first 2 years of the experiments, which received average or above average rainfall. During the drier 2009–2010 season CA had a negative effect on crop yield both in the on-farm trials (average yield of 730 and 820kgha−1 under CA and CP, respectively) and in the farmers’ cotton fields (average yield of 1220 and 1440kgha−1 under CA and CP, respectively). There was no difference in water runoff between CA and CP on a relatively fine-textured soil, but significantly more runoff with CA on a coarser-textured soil (14mm during the wetter 2008–2009 season), due to soil surface crusting and soil compaction. Most soils in the study area fall into this latter category. For this reason, farmers perceived ploughing as necessary during drier years to maximize water infiltration, but perceived CA as beneficial during wetter years as a means to ‘shed water’ and avoid water-logging. This is rather counterintuitive vis- ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: sorghum grain;cotton ### Programs found: consumer program (CP);community project (CP) ### Topics keywords: organic farming;soil erosion;cropping system;land degradation;CA;soil fertility;use efficiency;dry matter;carbon pool;factor affecting;bulk density;SSA;soil compaction;cropping practice;point view;drip irrigation;BMP;smallholder farming;flow rate;farming practice;farming system;negative effect;centrifugal pump;DM;human health;cluster analysis;conservation practice;soil organic carbon;farmer perception;management practice;CP;short term;genetic diversity;cover crop;spatial distribution;trace element;crude protein;factor influencing;extension service;smallholder farmer;human activity;sustainable agriculture;WUE ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2012,,Field crops research,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44679231&site=ehost-live,,#37619,,"",Experimental
Livestock and livelihoods of smallholder cattle-owning households in Cambodia: the contribution of on-farm and off-farm activities to income and food security,"","Abstract: The majority of smallholder farming households in Cambodia are rurally based and rely on agriculture to support their livelihoods. However, in recent years, growth in the agriculture sector has stagnated with farmers facing several challenges including declining prices for traditional crops and irregular rainfall patterns. This has led to a need for farmers to diversify income sources with livestock promoted as a more viable livelihood activity, particularly the raising of cattle and poultry. However, uncertain profitability of livestock activities is a common perception by smallholders, especially where animals have not been traditionally viewed as a primary income source. To address this, information is required which compares the income and expenses associated with livestock raising to other on-farm activities and off-farm sources. This study reports on a survey of livelihood survey of 17 male and 21 female representatives of 20 households owning cattle in Cambodia, comparing the associated income and expenses of the various livelihood activities in the 12-month period from January to December 2016. Combined total household income from both on-farm and off-farm sources ranged from USD875 to 17730 with an average of USD6779, representing 51% and 49% from on-farm and off-farm activities, respectively. Cattle raising was the most common source of on-farm income (85%), contributing USD1064 and representing 22% of total household income. General household expenses, such as food and transportation (including expenses associated with off-farm employment), represented the majority of total household expenses (79%). Gross profit calculations indicated higher values for pig raising (USD1841.79), cattle (USD950.80) and non-rice crops (USD884) whilst the highest gross margin value was recorded for cattle (89.33%) followed by vegetables (85.27%) and non-rice crops (83.08%). Whilst wet season and dry season rice returned a negative gross profit value of USD197.27 and USD90.60 on average per household, respectively, both were ranked as most important for household consumption, followed by poultry, providing the main source of energy (rice) and protein (chicken meat) and sustaining household food requirements. The study concludes that although smallholder cattle-owning households in Cambodia undertake a diverse range of on-farm activities, as cattle raising provides a superior income source due to higher returns and lower variable costs, it could be promoted as a preferred livelihood activity by agencies conducting rural extension activities. Although consideration of available labour and monetary funds to invest in cattle raising is required, it was observed that income from off-farm sources may prove beneficial in providing the additional monetary funds to support cattle-raising activities and assist in providing generally poor smallholder households with enhanced economic resilience. ### Countries mentioned: Cambodia ### Plant products search: rice;vegetables ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: farm income ### Topics keywords: soil fertility;sweet potato;gross margin;rural household;taking account;smallholder farming;dry season;agroforestry system;farming system;beef cattle;GM;small scale;crop rotation;household food security;non GM;dairy cattle;farm size;food security;food insecurity;spatial distribution;household income;crop residue;smallholder farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2018,,Tropical Animal Health and Production,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11250-018-1615-6,,#36760,,"",Observational
Maize crop residue uses and trade-offs on smallholder crop-livestock farms in Zimbabwe: Economic implications of intensification,"","Abstract: Decisions to use crop residues as soil cover for conservation agriculture create trade-offs for farmers who own cattle in crop-livestock systems. Trade-offs among soil C, crop and animal and crop productivity were analysed using the NUANCES-FARMSIM (FArm-scale Resource Management SIMulator) dynamic model. Retention on the soil surface of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of the maize stover yield produced per farm, and the use of the remainder as animal feed was quantified over a 12 year period for four farm types in Murehwa, Zimbabwe. Retaining 100% maize residues in the field led to an annual loss of on average 68and 93kg body weight per animal for cattle on farms of the relatively wealthiest farmers (Resource Group, RG1) who had most land and cattle and RG2 respectively), and is therefore unsustainable for livestock production. There was an increase in grain yield of 1.6tfarm-1 and 0.7tfarm-1 for RG1 and RG2 respectively. Farmers without cattle (RG3 and RG4) may have a greater incentive for retaining their crop residues but they have to invest labour to keep the residues during the dry season. However, improved crop productivity for these farmers is limited by lack of access to fertiliser. The current practice of allocating all crop residues to animals results in average gross margin of US$7429 and US$4037 for RG1 and RG2 farmers respectively. Our results showed that from an economic perspective, it is logical that farmers prioritise the sustenance of cattle with crop residues over soil fertility management. We conclude that at current productivity levels, farmers who own cattle have limited scope to allocate crop residues for soil cover as it leads to significant loss in animal production and economic value. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: maize stover ### Topics keywords: CA;soil fertility;animal feed;sweet potato;gross margin;environmental impact;taking account;dry season;agroforestry system;beef cattle;GM;body weight;raw material;small scale;trade offs;crop rotation;dairy cow;DM;significant difference;non GM;economic benefit;dairy cattle;farm size;animal husbandry;food insecurity;ecosystem service;spatial distribution;crop residue;human activity;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2015,,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2015.08.012,,#36176,,"",Modeling; Observational; livestock
Maize yields in varying rainfall regimes and cropping systems across Southern Africa: A modelling assessment,"","Abstract: Rainfall variability, which ultimately leads to climate change, is a major threat to smallholder agriculture. It affects time of sowing time and productivity, amongst other challenges. There is therefore need to evaluate the different strategies for their effectiveness in managing climate variability. This study assessed the effects of different strategies on sowing date, season length and maize yields under variable rainfall conditions. Maize (Zea mays L.) yield simulations for Southern Africa were conducted using the DSSAT model. Simulated conservation agriculture (CA)-based cropping systems included basins prepared early (CA-Basins early) and late (CABasins late), draught powered planter (CA-Direct seeder), ripper (CA-Ripper) and Dibble stick (CA-Dibble). Conventional systems were mouldboard ploughing early (CMP-early) and late (CMP-late). Rainfall seasons were classified into low, medium and high based on the total rainfall amount. Results showed that high-rainfall seasons were seeded earlier and had a greater season length compared to low rainfall seasons in drier agro-ecologies, translating to higher yields and vice versa. Reduced labour requirements and use of draught power, enabled early seeding of CA-ripper, direct seeder, basins early and CMP-early systems compared to CA-Basins late, Dibble stick and CMP-late systems. However, performance of cropping systems did not vary across season types suggesting that there was thus no evidence of higher yield advantages from CA technologies even during low rainfall seasons. This puts the merits of drought mitigation by CA technologies into doubt despite enabling early planting. ### Plant products search: maize;stone fruits ### Topics keywords: genetic diversity;food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;spatial distribution;trace element;cropping system;CA;zea may L;grain yield;growing season;cluster analysis;climate variability;human activity;CC;long term",2018,,University Initiatives in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-89590-1_12,,#36507,,"",Modeling

Is Sustainable Intensification Pro-Poor? Evidence from Small-Scale Farmers in Rural Tanzania,"","Abstract: The transition of farming systems to higher levels of productivity without overusing natural resources is of rising interest especially in African countries, where population growth has often been larger than past productivity increases. This paper aims to contribute to the debate on whether environmentally friendly agricultural practices are compatible with economic interests. In the context of small-scale farm households in Tanzania, the analysis focuses on Conservation Agriculture (CA) at different levels of agricultural output, as CA is a promising toolbox for sustainable intensification. The results are based on a household survey conducted in 2014 with 900 randomly selected small-scale farmers in rural Tanzania, i.e., in semi-arid Dodoma and in semi-humid Morogoro region. We find that mulching is most frequently applied, followed by crop rotation, fallowing, intercropping and tree planting. Logit regressions show that CA adoption is influenced by socio-economic factors, farm characteristics and the regional context. Quantile regressions explain different levels of agricultural output through variables related to the extent of using CA. They indicate that marginalized farmers have the strongest crop income effect from an increased use of mulching. With increasing levels of agricultural output, the use of mulching remains beneficial for farmers, but the effect appears less pronounced. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Topics keywords: natural resource;CA;factor affecting;rural household;survey conducted;farming system;small scale;crop rotation;cluster analysis;household survey;management practice;food security;genetic diversity;sustainable intensification;spatial distribution;trace element;extension service;small scale farmer;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2017,,RESOURCES-BASEL,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/resources6030047,,#37314,,"",""
Maize productivity and nutrient use efficiency in Western Kenya as affected by soil type and crop management,"","Abstract: Low soil fertility and high weed infestation are the main culprits for the declining maize production in Western Kenya. Technology packages to address these constraints exist, but their effectiveness is likely to be influenced by variability in soil types and farm management practices in the region. Trials were conducted during the 2008/2009 cropping seasons to investigate the nutrient use efficiency and yield response of maize to some recommended management options for smallholder farmers on three dominant soil types of Western Kenya namely Acrisol, Nitisol and Ferralsol. Irrespective of seasons, average maize yields were highest on Nitisol (3.6 t ha(-1)) and lowest on Ferralsol (2.1 t ha(-1)). Maize yield gaps (difference between potentially achievable and actual yields) differed by season and soils with 4-5 t ha(-1) on Nitisol and about 6 t grain ha(-1) on Acrisol and Ferralsol. On Nitisol, the largest share of this yield gap (80%) was closed by the addition of mineral fertilizer, while on Ferralsol, reduced tillage could close 25-60% of the yield gap. The highest agronomic (13-39 kg grain kg(-1) N) and physiological (50-160%) N use efficiencies were obtained with mineral fertilizers, while the addition of organic amendments resulted in the highest P use efficiency (15-154 kg grain kg(-1) P), irrespective of soil type and season. As soil types and management options differentially affect yields and nutrient use efficiency of maize, there is a need for field-specific targeting of technologies to address maize production constraints in Western Kenya. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: maize;grain ### Measurements for interventions: reduced tillage;tillage ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;soil fertility;use efficiency;NPK;NH4;weed infestation;RT;NO3;NT;organic amendment;NUE;reduced tillage;crop rotation;yield gap;management practice;organic fertilizer;cover crop;weed control;mineral fertilizer;crop residue;sewage sludge;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2013,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION,,,,,,,#36610,,"",Experimental
Making nursery compost for small scale farmers using local resources for substitution purposes to imported material in the Gambia (West Africa).,"","Abstract: In tropical Africa, transplant production in small scale horticulture which is generally carried out through nursery beds has proven unreliable and cost ineffective due to pest and rainfall damages. For more success, tray sowing (seedlings produced in trays and transplanted 3-4 weeks later) is being developed. This technique used on over 15 species, needs good quality compost currently imported from Europe, which makes it expensive (US$21/35-40 kg, over 51% of seedling cost) and sometimes unavailable. Twenty different substrates including 3 checks (imported, sand and clay) and different local resources [cow and chicken manures, ground nut shell dust (GNS) and diverse mixtures] were compared through tomato and cabbage hybrids sown on January 10, 2007. Assessment based on seedling growth (plant height weekly measured), compost compactness (4-scale procedure), sterility/absence of phytotoxicity, and plant behaviour after transplanting. Ten treatments out of the 20 produced viable seedlings, with significant differences in plant behaviour. In particular, imported compost and GNS performed very well [final plant height after 4 weeks=168 and 85 mm (imported) for tomato and cabbage respectively vs. 171 and 79 mm (GNS)]. Sand and clay were less effective [97 and 65 mm for tomato and cabbage (sand), 123 and 69 mm respectively (clay)]. As it relates to compactness, these 2 treatments were also the best ones. Cow and chicken manures had lower performance (possible link with phytotoxicity). Transplanted seedlings behaved well for the best treatments. If confirmed, GNS (free material) could be the basis of local nursery compost making (40.5% cost reduction). Follow-up investigations discussed relate to further trials to confirm and improve findings. ### Countries mentioned: Gambia ### Plant products search: groundnuts;tomatoes;leafy vegetables ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: cost reduction;compost;seedling ### Topics keywords: organic fertilizer;small scale;plant height;significant difference;chicken manure;extension service;small scale farmer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;Europe and Central Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2007,,"8th African Crop Science Society Conference, El-Minia, Egypt, 27-31 October 2007",,,,,,,#37658,,"",""
Modelling of long term pasture production and estimation of carrying capacity of Ankole pastoral production system in South Western Uganda,"","Abstract: The Ankole pastoral production system in South Western Uganda is based on grazing without supplementary feeding. A stochastic simulation model was developed to determine the dynamics of pastures grazed by Ankole cattle and their Holstein Friesian crosses and the carrying capacity (CC) of the livestock grazing system. The model used the concept of rain use efficiency which relates pasture production to rainfall. A cross sectional study was carried out on 16 selected farms and data on number of animals, sex, age group and size of available grazing land was collected. The similarity between the results of the simulation rainfall runs and field data are considered to be satisfactory. The overall annual forage production is 3905 ± 72kg/ha. The lowest CC (5.65 ± 0.75) occurs in long dry season (June to August) while the highest CC (1.41 ± 0.06 ha/TLU) occurs in short rain season (September to November). Annual carrying capacity ranges between 1.88 and 2.08 ha/TLU with an overall mean of 1.95 ± 0.04 ha/TLU. Sixty three (63%) percent of the surveyed farms have stocking rates that are higher than the CC throughout the year while the rest are overstocked in the dry seasons of the year. The results indicate that CC is dynamic and its variability is more pronounced within the year than between years. In response to seasonal CC, the major point of intervention in regard to reduction of actual stocking rates could be done in May shortly before the start of the long dry season. For Ankole pastoral system to be sustainable, the stocking rate should not go below 1.41 ha/TLU. ### Countries mentioned: Uganda ### Measurements for interventions: forage;forage production ### Topics keywords: small scale;stocking rate;food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;spatial distribution;use efficiency;dairy farm;climatic change;dry season;agroforestry system;dairy cattle;crop residue;sweet potato;human activity;beef cattle;CC;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2009,,Livestock Research for Rural Development,,,,,,,#36897,,"",Modeling; livestock
New low pressure system for pulse drip irrigation,"","Abstract: The installation of modern irrigation system can be very costly for small farming operations. To solve this problem, a new low pressure pulse drip irrigation system has been designed and developed. It is characterized by a low operating head requiring lower power consumption and lower installation costs. The installation consists of an automatic hydraulic irrigation tank which is filled slowly with water. The tank feeds the drippers, which were equipped with emitters of varying flow capacity thus allowing a uniform distribution of irrigation water. ### Plant products search: grain legumes ### Topics keywords: energy consumption;drip irrigation system;drip irrigation;flow rate",1997,,International Water and Irrigation,,,,,,,#37282,,"",Experimental; interventions; livestock
Managing soil fertility to adapt to rainfall variability in smallholder cropping systems in Zimbabwe,"","Abstract: Adaptation options that address short-term climate variability are likely to lead to short-term benefits and will help to deal with future changes in climate in smallholder cropping systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this study we combined field experimentation and long-term rainfall analyses in Makoni and Hwedza districts in eastern Zimbabwe to evaluate cropping adaptation options to climate variability. Analyses of long-term rainfall data closely supports farmers' perceptions that the mean annual total rainfall has not changed, but the pattern of rainfall within-season has changed: the number of rainfall days has decreased, and the frequency of dry spells has increased at the critical flowering stage of maize. On-farm experiments were conducted over two cropping seasons, 2009/10 and 2010/11 to assess the effects of planting date, fertilization and cultivar on maize production. Three maize cultivars were sown in each of the early, normal and late planting windows defined by farmers. Each of the nine cultivar-planting date combinations received N, P, K and manure combinations at either zero, low or high fertilization rates. Overall, there were no significant differences in maize development or grain yield among cultivars. Maize grain yield was increased by increasing the amount of nutrients applied. Average yield was 2.5tha-1 for the low rate and 5.0tha-1 for the high rate on early planted cultivars on relatively fertile soils in Makoni in 2009/10 season. Yields on poorer soils in Hwedza were small, averaging 1.5tha-1 for the low rate and 2.5tha-1 for the high rate. Maize grain yields for the early and normal planted cultivars were similar for each fertilization rate, suggesting there is a wide planting window for successful establishment of crops in response to increased rainfall variability. Yield reduction of &gt;50% was observed when planting was delayed by 4 weeks (late planting) regardless of the amount of fertilizer applied. Soil nutrient management had an overriding effect on crop production, suggesting that although the quality of within-season rainfall is decreasing, nutrient management is the priority option for adaptation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: maize;stone fruits;grain ### Topics keywords: experiment conducted;cropping system;land degradation;soil fertility;dry matter;SSA;drip irrigation;NH4;NO3;flow rate;long term;significant difference;farmer perception;climate variability;management practice;short term;food insecurity;climate change;plant height;growing season;extension service;smallholder farmer;human activity;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2013,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2013.08.012,,#37004,,Abdrahmane Wane (2019-06-26 21:16:41)(Screen): climate change; ,Experimental
Multiple cropping for raising productivity and farm income of small farmers.,"","Abstract: Multiple cropping is an agriculture system long adopted by marginalized small holder farmers especially in hills and mountains. This practice was a meant to enhance farm productivity when farming area is limited. Here, in this paper, a brief review on the benefits of multiple cropping is presented focusing on the practices adopted by marginalized farmers, in general. In multiple cropping, it is generally argued that the practice favors an efficient utilization of resources like air, water, light, space, and nutrients by companion crops in both temporal and spatial dimensions due to their differential growth habits and seasonality. Multiple cropping could be one of the viable alternatives to cope uncertainties and changes, where food and nutritional uncertainty looming large. The ultimate outcome of multiple cropping could be visualized in adverse or harsh environment for increase agriculture production, livelihood and income. Various food products are obtained through multiple cropping. Land equivalent ratio (LER), relative yield total (RYT) and income equivalent ratio (IER) can be increased with mixed/intercropping systems. Multiple cropping helps in getting more than one crop simultaneously, so even if the selling price of one commodity is less, the other might compensate. In the tropics, smallholder farms, which produce over 60% of the food resources of developing nations from intercropping of cereals with many crops mostly legumes, had been the field of much investigation because of synergistic effects of diversifying food production and household cash incomes in these systems. This clearly implies the importance of multiple cropping for small farmers who constitute majority in the developing countries. ### Plant products search: legumes;cereals ### Animal products search: meat ### Topics keywords: intercropping system;developing country;cropping system;net return;LER",2016,,Journal of Nepal Agricultural Research Council,,,,,,,#36698,,Abdrahmane Wane (2019-06-26 19:53:19)(Screen): Not really a water scarcity context but maybe interesting to explore a bit; ,""
On-farm evaluation of yield and economic benefit of short term maize legume intercropping systems under conservation agriculture in Malawi,"","Abstract: Low crop yields due to continuous monocropping and deteriorating soil health in smallholder farmers' fields of sub-Saharan Africa have led to a quest for sustainable production practices with greater resource use efficiency. The aim of the study was to elucidate the short term effects of conservation agriculture (CA) systems on soil quality, crop productivity and profitability. In Balaka market and Ntonda sections of Manjawira Extension Planning Area (EPA), in Ntcheu district, central Malawi, we compared continuous monocropped maize (Zea mays) under conventional tillage practice (CP) with different CA systems in continuous monocropped maize (CAM) and intercropping with pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) (CAMP), Mucuna pruriens (CAMM), and Lablab purpureus (L.) (Sweet) (CAML). The study was conducted from 2008 to 2011 in 72 plots in 24 farmers' fields. In Balaka market section CA plots with maize+legumes produced up to 4.3Mgha -1 of vegetative biomass against 3.5Mgha -1 for maize alone in CP. In Ntonda section CA plots with maize+legumes produced up to 4.6Mgha -1 of vegetative biomass against 2.4Mgha -1 for maize alone in CP. In both sections, during the entire study period, CA did not have a negative effect on crop yields. During the drier seasons of 2009/10 and 2010/11, CA had a positive effect on maize grain yield at both sites (average yield of 4.4 and 3.3Mgha -1 in CA and CP respectively). However, associating maize with legumes reduced maize yields compared to CAM particularly in drier years of 2009-10 and 2010-11. Farmers spent at most 47daysha -1 producing maize under CA systems compared to 65daysha -1 spent under conventional tillage practices. However, total variable costs were higher in CA systems compared to conventional practice (at most US$416 versus US$344ha -1). CAMP resulted in more than double gross margin compared to CPM (US$705 versus US$344ha -1). Infiltration estimated as time to pond was highest in CA maize legume intercrops (8.1s) than CP (6.8s). Although it was not feasible to directly estimate effects on water balances of these farmer-managed experiments, it can be assumed that the yield differences between CA and CP could be attributed to tillage and crop residue cover since other farm operations were generally the same. Intercropping maize and pigeonpea under CA presents a win-win scenario due to crop yield improvement and attractive economic returns provided future prices of maize and pigeonpea grain remain favourable. ### Countries mentioned: Malawi ### Plant products search: maize;grain;grain legumes ### Programs found: consumer program (CP);community project (CP) ### Measurements for crops: maize;grain ### Measurements for interventions: CPM;intercrop;tillage;CA;conventional tillage ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;cropping system;CA;use efficiency;dry matter;sweet potato;gross margin;carbon pool;factor affecting;tillage practice;net return;SSA;cropping practice;point view;conventional tillage;taking account;BMP;flow rate;beef cattle;GM;NT;negative effect;small scale;centrifugal pump;crop rotation;DM;human health;cluster analysis;CT;conservation practice;soil organic carbon;non GM;economic benefit;farm size;management practice;CP;short term;genetic diversity;cover crop;spatial distribution;intercropping system;trace element;crude protein;factor influencing;crop residue;smallholder farmer;human activity;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2012,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.12.014,,#36308,,"",""
Overview of ecosystem-based approaches to drought risk reduction targeting small- scale farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa,"","Abstract: Rain-fed agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) provides major but highly climate-dependent sources of livelihoods. Recurrent dry spells and droughts can impact SSA’s agro-ecosystems in multiple ways, negatively affecting local social-ecological systems (SES). Droughts not only destroy crops and livestock and degrade natural resources but also impact a large variety of ecosystem services. However, ecosystems can also frequently be powerful agents for drought mitigation and resilient livelihoods. Ecosystem-based approaches mitigate drought impacts while providing multiple co-benefits which contribute to poverty alleviation and sustainable development, food security, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and livelihood resilience. In drought risk management, ecosystem-based solutions have always been important, even if not explicitly acknowledged as such. Based on available literature, this chapter provides an overview of approaches for drought risk reduction in SSA in the context of ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). Using selected criteria, the review found many types of approaches, which strengthen functionality of the ecosystem and offer substantial environmental and socio-economic benefits, and thus help to mitigate drought impacts. More information on the limits of these approaches is needed in order to integrate them effectively into Eco-DRR and EbA programmes and complement them with more traditional disaster risk reduction strategies. ### Programs found: eba program ### Topics keywords: natural resource;carbon sequestration;agro ecosystem;poverty alleviation;SSA;small scale farmer;rural household;point view;agroforestry system;pest control;long term;small scale;soil organic carbon;protected area;rural development;economic benefit;biodiversity conservation;management practice;food security;ecosystem service;sustainable development;specie richness;extension service;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2016,,Advances in Natural and Technological Hazards Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-43633-3_9,,#36316,,"",Systematic Review
Perceptions and performance of conservation agriculture practices in northwestern Ghana.,"","Abstract: Agriculture in Northwestern Ghana is subsistence in nature with low productivity due to continuous monocropping of cereals with low input usage. Conservation agriculture has been introduced in the northwestern part of Ghana in 2010 as a potential intervention to address these issues. A baseline study was conducted to gather farmers' biophysical and socio-economic characteristics, farming methods and a knowledge index of conservation agriculture practices. The knowledge index indicated limited understanding of most of the components of conservation agriculture practices by both male and female farmers. Two farmer field schools aimed at promoting the conservation agricultural practices were conducted and offered to approximately 1/3 of all individuals surveyed at the baseline. These same farmers were resurveyed in 2012 in order to determine whether their knowledge on conservation agriculture practices has changed using a double-difference approach. The approach is also be used to determine whether innate perceptions and biases against conservation agriculture have changed over time through the field schools. These findings are supported with partial budgets on conservation practices in order to determine whether knowledge or on-farm economics limit adoption of conservation practices. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;cover crop;field school;CA;IPM;conservation practice;adoption CA;BMP;farm size;FFS;socio economic characteristic;management practice ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2014,,Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2013.11.015,,#36557,,"",Experimental
Plant diversity moderates drought stress in grasslands: Implications from a large real-world study on C-13 natural abundances,"","Abstract: Land-use change and intensification play a key role in the current biodiversity crisis. The resulting species loss can have severe effects on ecosystem functions and services, thereby increasing ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. We explored whether land-use intensification (i.e. fertilization intensity), plant diversity and other potentially confounding environmental factors may be significantly related to water use (i.e. drought stress) of grassland plants. Drought stress was assessed using delta C-13 abundances in aboveground plant biomass of 150 grassland plots across a gradient of land-use intensity. Underwater shortage, plants are forced to increasingly take up the heavier C-13 due to closing stomata leading to an enrichment of C-13 in biomass. Plants were sampled at the community level and for single species, which belong to three different functional groups (one grass, one herb, two legumes). Results show that plant diversity was significantly related to the delta C-13 signal in community, grass and legume biomass indicating that drought stress was lower under higher diversity, although this relation was not significant for the herb species under study. Fertilization, in turn, mostly increased drought stress as indicated by more positive delta C-13 values. This effect was mostly indirect by decreasing plant diversity. In line with these results, we found similar patterns in the delta C-13 signal of the organic matter in the topsoil, indicating a long history of these processes. Our study provided strong indication for a positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship with reduced drought stress at higher plant diversity. However, it also underlined a negative reinforcing situation: as land-use intensification decreases plant diversity in grasslands, this might subsequently increases drought sensitivity. Vice-versa, enhancing plant diversity in species-poor agricultural grasslands may moderate negative effects of future climate change. ### Plant products search: legumes ### Measurements for interventions: plant biomass ### Topics keywords: drought stress;LUC;functional group;factor affecting;point view;negative effect;land use change;DM;human health;organic matter;land use intensity;short term;ecosystem service;cover crop;climate change;ecosystem function;OM;land use;specie richness;factor influencing;human activity;CC",2016,,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.008,,#36482,,"",Experimental

In this study, /maize stalks (Td: MS) ratios: 0:100, 25:80, 20:80, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 75:25, 80:20 and 100:0 (v/v) were prepared and then composted using composting technology. The TKN and organic carbon, nitrate-N, C/N ratios and pH were determined using standard methods. Results showed significantly higher TKN and nitrate-N and lower final C/N ratios in composts produced using blending ratios of above 40% than those below (0% (p&lt;0.001, α=0.01), 20% (p&lt;0.018, α=0.05) and 25% (p&lt;0.028, α=0.05)). Empirical models of the form Y=mX+C (where Y=T. diversifolia percentage and X=TKN or Nitrate-N percentage) were developed indicating significant effect of on TKN and nitrate-N on resultant composts. Results also showed significant improvement in TKN and nitrate-N content and C/N ratios in composts with blending ratios of Td:MS=40:60, Td:MS=50:50 and Td:MS=60:40 (v/v) hence judged optimal. The observed significance is attributed to optimal initial C/N ratios, moisture and porosity of the composite ingredients that enhanced active and rapid microbial aerobic activities that limited nitrogen volatilization. Blending composition of greater than 60% of yielded reduced quantities of TKN and nitrate-N besides possessing greater quantities of nitrogen rich ingredients. The observations suggest occurrence of significant nitrogen volatilization. Thus, optimal Td:MS blending composition in the range of 50:50 to 60:40 (v/v) should be promoted as one strategy of improving quality of composts among smallholder farmers. ### Plant products search: maize ### Measurements for interventions: compost;MS ### Topics keywords: CAP;bulk density;EC;soil fertility;dairy industry;soil organic carbon;EU;OC;organic carbon;among smallholder farmer;NH4;market share;rural development;NO3;member state;smallholder farmer;DOC",2013,,Journal of Agricultural Science (Toronto),,,,,,,#36992,,"",interventions; livestock
Tools for optimizing management of spatially-variable fields,"","Abstract: Efficient use of agro-chemicals is beneficial for farmers as well as for the environment. Spatial and temporal optimization of farm management will increase productivity or reduce the amount of agro-chemicals. This type of management is referred to as Precision Agriculture. Traditional management implicitly considers any field to be a homogeneous unit for management: fertilization, tillage and crop protection measures, for example, are not varied within a single field. The question for management is what to do when. Because of the variability within the field, this implies inefficient use of resources. Precision agriculture defines different management practices to be applied within single, variable fields, potentially reducing costs and limiting adverse environmental side effects. The question is not only what and when but also where. Many tools for management and analysis of spatial variable fields have been developed. In this paper, tools for managing spatial variability are demonstrated in combination with tools to optimize management in environmental and economic terms. The tools are illustrated on five case studies ranging from (1) a low technology approach using participatory mapping to derive fertilizer recommendations for resource-poor farmers in Embu, Kenya, (2) an example of backward modelling to analyze fertilizer applications and restrict nitrogen losses to the groundwater in the Wieringermeer in The Netherlands, (3) a low-tech approach of precision agriculture, developed for a banana plantation in Costa Rica to achieve higher input use efficiency and insight in spatial and temporal variation, (4) a high-tech, forward modelling approach to derive fertilizer recommendations for management units in Zuidland in The Netherlands, and (5) a high-tech, backward modelling approach to detect the relative effects of several stress factors on soybean yield. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;Costa Rica;Netherlands ### Plant products search: soybeans;bananas ### Topics keywords: spatial distribution;use efficiency;spatial variability;management practice;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean;Europe and Central Asia;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD;BLEND;Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2001,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0308-521X(01)00055-5,,#36899,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-12 07:21:24)(Screen): Doesn't appear to have a counterfactual.; ,interventions; livestock
"The Use of Rainfall Forecasts as a Decision Guide for Small-scale Farming in Limpopo Province, South Africa","","Abstract: Purpose: New innovative ways of communicating agrometeorological information are needed to help farmers, especially subsistence/small-scale farmers, to cope with the high climate variability experienced in most parts of southern Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The article introduces an early warning system for farmers. It utilizes short messaging system (SMS) to convey weather information and basic agronomic advice to 12 small-scale farmers in Makhado Municipality, Limpopo Province, South Africa. This case study demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating weather information on day-to-day farm management activities. Coded rainfall forecasts for light (0-5mm), medium (5-20mm) and heavy rainfall (>20mm) were distributed three times a week to individual farmers and extension officers. Accompanying the forecasts were possible agricultural activities for the week. Findings: Extensive training of the farmers and extension officers is a pre-requisite for full comprehension of the coded SMS early warning system. The recommendations on farming conditions are not always adhered to due to farmers' indigenous knowledge and other factors like access to labour. Practical implications: Weather and climate information distributed to farmers has the potential to add value to the farming methods employed, hence positively impacting on rural food security. Originality/value: The article demonstrates that agrometeorological information must be packaged in such a way as to assist farmers and should be disseminated timeously and appropriately to maximize its utility or adoption. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Topics keywords: drought stress;SA;originality value;long term;small scale;indigenous knowledge;climate variability;medicinal plant;design methodology approach;food security;food insecurity;climate change;crop insurance;supply chain;growing season;soil moisture;soil moisture sensor;extension service;small scale farmer;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2013,,Journal of Agricultural Education and Extension,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/1389224X.2012.734253,,#36725,,"",interventions; livestock
"Tillage, mulch and fertiliser impacts on soil nitrogen availability and maize production in semi-arid Zimbabwe","","Abstract: Conservation agriculture has been promoted widely in sub-Saharan African to cushion smallholder farmers against the adverse effects of soil fertility decline, stabilize crop yields and increase resilience to climate change and variability. Our study aimed to determine if aspects of CA, namely tillage and mulching with manure and fertiliser application, improved soil mineral N release, plant N uptake and maize yields in cropping systems on poor soils in semi-arid Matobo, Zimbabwe. The experiment, run for three seasons (2012/13–2014/15), was a split-split plot design with three replicates. Tillage (animal-drawn ploughing and ripping) was the main plot treatment and residue application was the sub plot treatment with two levels (100% residues removed or retained after harvest). Five fertility amendments (mineral fertiliser at 0, 20 and 40 kg N ha-1, 5 t ha-1 manure only and 5 t ha-1 manure + 20 kg N ha-1) were sub-sub plot treatments. Plough tillage stimulated N mineralisation by 4–19 kg N ha-1 and maize N uptake 13–23% more than the ripper tillage. When mulch was added to the plough tillage, mineralisation was slowed resulting in less crop N uptake (by 5–19%) compared with no mulch application. N uptake was highest in the manure treatments. N recovery and agronomic N efficiency by maize were highly variable over the three seasons, reflecting the uncertainty complicating farmers’ decision making. Nitrogen recovery in the manure treatments was generally poor in the first season resulting in low grain yields in the range 100–260 kg ha-1 regardless of tillage, though higher in subsequent seasons. In the second season manure application gave the largest grain yields under the ripper tillage, both with and without mulch averaging 1850 and 2228 kg ha-1 respectively. Under the plough tillage, the 40 kg N ha-1 treatment gave the highest grain yields of 1985 kg ha-1. In the third season yields were generally poor under all treatments due to low and poorly-distributed rainfall. The CA principles of minimum soil disturbance and maintenance of a permanent mulch cover resulted in reduced soil mineral N availability for crop uptake and poor maize yields. Nutrient inputs through mineral fertilisers and manure are key to ensuring production in such infertile, sandy soils which predominate in semi-arid regions of southern Africa. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: manure ### Topics keywords: cropping system;CA;soil fertility;use efficiency;highest grain yield;adverse effect;SSA;NH4;NO3;human health;cluster analysis;residue retention;decision making;genetic diversity;cover crop;climate change;spatial distribution;trace element;N uptake;smallholder farmer;CC;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2017,,Soil and Tillage Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2016.12.007,,#36571,,"",interventions; livestock
Modeling the impacts of conservation agriculture with a drip irrigation system on the hydrology and water management in Sub-Saharan Africa,"","Abstract: The agricultural system in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is dominated by traditional farming practices with poor soil and water management, which contributes to soil degradation and low crop productivity. This study integrated field experiments and a field-scale biophysical model (Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender, APEX) to investigate the impacts of conservation agriculture (CA) with a drip irrigation system on the hydrology and water management as compared to the conventional tillage (CT) practice. Field data were collected from four study sites; Dangishita and Robit (Ethiopia), Yemu (Ghana), and Mkindo (Tanzania) to validate APEX for hydrology and crop yield simulation. Each study site consisted of 100 m 2 plots divided equally between CA and CT practices and both had a drip irrigation setup. Cropping pattern, management practices, and irrigation scheduling were monitored for each experimental plot. Significant water savings (α = 0.05) were observed under CA practice; evapotranspiration and runoff were reduced by up to 49% and 62%, respectively, whereas percolation increased up to three-fold. Consequently, irrigation water need was reduced in CA plots by about 14-35% for various crops. CA coupled with drip irrigation was found to be an efficient water saving technology and has substantial potential to sustain and intensify crop production in the region. ### Countries mentioned: United States;Ghana;Ethiopia;Tanzania ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;organic farming;cropping system;land degradation;CA;water saving;drip irrigation system;SSA;winter wheat;conventional tillage;drip irrigation;farming practice;farming system;NT;cropping pattern;crop rotation;cluster analysis;conservation tillage;soil organic carbon;carbon storage;economic benefit;management practice;genetic diversity;ecosystem service;spatial distribution;trace element;growing season;crop residue;smallholder farmer;CT;sustainable agriculture;field experiment ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2018,,Sustainability (Switzerland),,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/su10124763,,#36386,,"",Experimental
Mulberry - a multi purpose tree species for varied climate.,"","Abstract: Mulberry (Morus spp., family Moraceae) is a popular fruit of India. It is cultivated in various climatic conditions, however, the major cultivation area is in the tropical zone covering Karnataka. Mulberry is a truly multipurpose tree, grown for fresh fruits, foliage for rearing silkworm and animal fodder during lean period. Therefore, it is a recommended as multi purpose tree species (MPTS) for agroforestry in small farms of semi-arid India. Mulberry is a fast growing deciduous woody perennial of varying sizes with a deep root system. There are three types of mulberry-red, white and black. Plants are either dioecious or monoecious. The fruit is a sorosis, which is not a berry but a collective fruit. There are 68 species of the genus Morus. Most of the Indian varieties of mulberry belong to M. indica. Some recommended cultivars for rainfed regions of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are: Kanya-2, S-13 and S-34. It can be propagated by seeds, stem cuttings, layering and grafting. Mulberry thrives well under varied climatic conditions ranging from temperate to tropical, located north of the equator between 28° N and 55° N latitude. The ideal range of temperature is from 24 to 28°C. Mulberry flourishes well in soils that are deep, fertile, well drained, loamy to clayey, with good moisture holding capacity. Land for mulberry cultivation is ploughed deep (30-35 cm). It requires full sun for controlling growth and leaf quality, however, a closer spacing is recommended for foliage cultivation. Seedlings are transplanted in December-January. It grows well in places with an annual rainfall between 600 to 2500 mm. No irrigation is required in well-grown trees. Mulberry generally thrives well with minimal fertilization. However, application of compost (20 t/ha/yr) during December-January is helpful for good fruiting. Under Indian conditions, it is ready for harvest in May-June in north India, while in the northeast it is harvested in October-November. After six months of planting, mulberry attains a height of 1.5 to 1.75 m and is ready for foliage harvesting. Generally the expected foliage yield is 100-125 t/ha/yr. Mulberry can be successfully grown as an intercrop between rows of tea/coffee as shade plants. Mulberry is a hardy multipurpose tree and can be grown successfully in semiarid region with natural vegetation. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: soft fruits ### Measurements for interventions: compost ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;paddy field;winter wheat;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;NH4;TP;NO3;NH4 N;long term ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2010,,Range Management and Agroforestry,,,,,,,#36678,,"",Observational

Multiple Water Use Protocols in Integrated Farming System for Enhancing Productivity,"","Abstract: Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in world. Due to demand of water for industrial and drinking purposes, the share of available water resources in agriculture sector is reducing substantially in near future. However, the food, fodder, fuel, and fibre production for satisfying the demands of enhanced population requires more water. In this scenario, increasing water productivity through diversified farming system has been identified as one of the viable options. Diversified farming, otherwise also called integrated farming system (IFS), represents integration of various enterprises such as cropping systems, horticulture, animal husbandry, fishery, agro-forestry, apiary etc. for optimal utilization of farm resources besides water. Integrated farming, a judicious mix of cropping systems suited to given agro-climatic conditions and socio-economic status of the farmers, shall be able to generate additional employment and income for the small and marginal farmers under both rain-fed and irrigated environment. Although, IFS was mainly initiated in Asian agriculture, it is being introduced in almost all the countries of world. Such a system results in more rationale use of water with judicious distribution among different users. In this paper, different aspects of multiple uses of water for higher productivity and future strategies for enhancing water productivity are discussed. ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;cropping system;winter wheat;growing season;climatic condition;taking account;IFS;farming system;long term",2012,,Water Resources Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-012-0035-z,,#36752,,"",Observational

Hydrogels provide effective solutions to the problems of moisture stress by maximizing land and water productivity. Though, synthetic polymers (hydrogels) were introduced in India for agricultural uses in early 1980's but has not become popular in high volume major crops due to their prohibitive cost (&gt;'2000/kg) and poor delivery system to root zones by recommended soil application which has been now improved with the use of cost effective ('300/kg) herbal hydrogel Tragacanth-Katira gel coupled with farmer's friendly seed priming cum hydrogel coating technology developed by Lather et al. 2015 which has shown promises for mitigation of sub-optimal moisture stresses, water saving and maximizing the water productivity for production of more crop per drop of water by making agriculture sustainable and resilient to climatic variability. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: drought stress;dry matter accumulation;DM;water saving;seed germination;soil moisture;drip irrigation;BMP;cost effective;economic benefit;dry matter;root zone;pest control ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,International Journal of Tropical Agriculture,,,,,,,#37613,,"",Experimental
"Positive externalities, knowledge exchange and corporate farm extension services; a case study on creating shared value in a water scarce area","","Abstract: Despite much rhetoric about the 'greening business' agenda and various initiatives to promote the valuation of ecosystem services and natural capital, the corporate sector has been slow to integrate social and environmental factors into core business models and to extend this integration across their supply chain. Our effort to narrow this thematic and methodological gap focuses on the co-benefits and positive externalities that can be generated through progressive knowledge exchange between a corporation and its suppliers. Using a case study of contract farming of malting barley in water scarce Rajasthan (India), we examine the extent to which best practice agronomic advice given by corporate farm extension workers can help small scale farmers (suppliers) to increase income, improve resource efficiency (water, fertiliser, energy) and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Findings from our desk study suggest positive results for all these variables, when compared to the regional benchmark of non-participating farmers. Under a scenario where advice is provided on all major crops (not just barley), we find a significant further increase of farm income. Our valuation of the reduced exploitation of ground water (alone) exceeds the advisors' annual salaries, suggesting that under full social and environmental accounting, the extension services are not a cost factor, but a profit making unit of the company. We discuss of our findings in relation to alternative approaches to PES and alternative investment strategies in green technologies. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: barley ### Topics keywords: EC;contract farming;GHG emission;chemical fertilizer;environmental impact;CF;N2O;SC;GHG;small scale;ICT;DM;natural capital;extension worker;greenhouse gas;social capital;ecosystem service;supply chain;CH4;extension service;small scale farmer;greenhouse gas emission ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Ecosystem Services,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.05.009,,#36410,,"",Observational

We make comparisons within the beneficiary community and between the beneficiary community and an adjacent community that, while not affected directly from irrigation services, was indirectly affected through expanded labor market opportunities arising from irrigation. Results of the analyses, including poverty and inequality decompositions, suggest lowland irrigation development led to reduced income inequality and lower rates of poverty in the lowland community, reduced inequality and lower rates of poverty for the group of upland households who participated in off-farm work on irrigated lowland farms, and higher overall income inequality between the lowland and upland communities. ### Countries mentioned: Philippines ### Topics keywords: factor influencing;rural household;farm size ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,Asian Journal of Agriculture and Development,,,,,,,#37019,,"",Experimental; Observational
"Poverty reduction with irrigation investment: An empirical case study from Tigray, Ethiopia","","Abstract: The regional government of Tigray has invested millions of dollars to develop irrigation schemes as a strategy of poverty reduction. However, there has been limited attempt to analyze whether these investments have attained their stated objectives of poverty reduction and overall socio-economic enhancement. Therefore, we endeavor to: (1) evaluate the impacts of access to small-scale irrigation on farm household's income and poverty status, (2) contribute to the scant literature on irrigation and poverty reduction in Ethiopia, and (3) provide information for policy makers. We examine a representative sample of 613 farm households (331 irrigators and 282 non-irrigators) drawn using three-stage stratified sampling with Probability Proportional to Size. We find that the average income of non-irrigating households is less than that of the irrigating households by about 50%. The overall average income gain due to access to irrigation ranges from 4000 Birr to 4500 Birr per household per annum. We find also that farming income is more important to irrigating households than to non-irrigating households, and off-farm income is negatively related with access to irrigation. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Topics keywords: small scale;small scale irrigation scheme;natural resource;developing country;water saving;rural household;willingness pay;household income;decision making;contract farming;irrigation scheme;policy maker;poverty reduction ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2009,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.08.004,,#36711,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-20 01:16:17)(Screen): This appears to be an observational design rather than experimental.; ,Experimental; Observational
"Mechanizing the manual <i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">zaï</i> technique in semiarid areas.","","Abstract: Manual practice is a traditional system used in the Sahel for the rehabilitation of degraded and crusted soils. It consists in manually digging pits that collect runoff water and receive a handful of organic resources. In view of the fact that manual is labour-intensive (300 heures.man/ha), the technique of mechanised using cattle traction has been studied on structurally degraded Lixisols in Burkina Faso (Saria, Pougyango). Labour time was reduced to 36 heures/ha at Saria and to 22 heures/ha at Pougyango. Animal traction force was 11.6 daN for 7.8 cm of tillage depth at Saria and 10.1 daN for 11.6 cm of tillage depth at Pougyango. Both mechanised and manual pits had the same sizes. Mechanised increased soil roughness by 14% while sorghum grain yield increase was 34% compared to that obtained with manual which is approximately 1 ton in a normal year in the northern part of the country. The mechanization of the generated a significant income that could reach 165 000 F CFA/ha with sorghum cropping. It may therefore constitute an interesting alternative for increasing the income of the smallholders besides contributing to the preservation of the environment. ### Countries mentioned: Burkina Faso ### Plant products search: sorghum grain;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: tillage depth;traction force;tillage ### Topics keywords: CA;grain yield;farm size ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2005,,Cahiers Agricultures,,,,,,,#36363,,"",""
Modeling sustainable adaptation strategies toward a climate-smart agriculture in a Mediterranean watershed under projected climate change scenarios.,"","Abstract: Climate change projections for the Mediterranean region are predicting a significant rainfall decrease and an increase of temperatures. The consequences of these changes on food security and natural resources in this region might be very dramatic. Anticipating climate change impacts by improving agricultural systems efficiency is a critical need. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the vulnerability of water resources and performance of two major rainfed crops (Winter wheat & Sunflower) to climate change impact in R'dom watershed. The study aimed also, to evaluate some adaptation strategies to improve crops water productivities while preserving hydrologic resources. The study site is a typical Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral watershed in North-western Morocco, where water resources are facing an increasing demand. Both hydrologic and plants growth modules of Soil and Water Assessment Tool Model (SWAT) have been calibrated and validated over the period 2004 to 2009. SWAT model and downscaled Global Circulation Model CNRM CM5 were used to simulate water yield and crops water productivities in 2031-2050 period under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The RCM data revealed that the study area will experience important precipitation drop and mean temperature increase in the period 2031 to 2050. About 26.4% (2.89) decrease of basin water yield and up to 44.7% (9.03) drop down of crops water productivities were consequently predicted. After simulation of 5 combinations of no tillage and two early sowing dates' strategies, TOPSIS technique was used to prioritize strategies according to different management policies. Both no tillage and the 10 days early sowing strategies have stood out as two best adaptation strategies among the management policies evaluated as compared to business as usual. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco ### Plant products search: winter wheat;stone fruits;wheat ### Programs found: rangeland convertion program (RCP);watershed project ### Topics keywords: CSA;land use change;cover crop;climate change;natural resource;adaptation strategy;winter wheat;SWAT;BMP;contract farming;smallholder farmer;climate change scenario;assessment tool;CC;food security ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2018,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2018.01.024,,#37371,,"",Experimental
Pedological aspects of land evaluation for in-field rainwater harvesting in south Africa,"","Abstract: The in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH) technique was designed for improving crop yields of subsistence farmers in semi-arid areas in South Africa. An appropriate soil survey to identify suitable land was developed by means of a field study near Thaba Nchu, South Africa. Results of the land Type Survey of South Africa (scale 1 : 250 000) were used to advantage. Areas suitable for IRWH on two soilscapes were delineated at a scale of 1 : 10 000. Although the procedure was satisfactory, to provide accuracy appropriate for small plots a scale of 1 : 5000 is recommended. The most important pedological characteristic of an IRWH-suitable soil is its capacity to store plant-available water, termed total extractable soil water (TESW). Satisfactory TESW values for maize and sunflower are>150mm, values which occur on fine-textured soils at least 900mm in depth. Other important characteristics are the absence of hydromorphy shallower than 700mm, and a low final infiltration rate that promotes runoff into the basins. The reliability of land evaluation for IRWH can be enhanced by using appropriate crop models together with long-term climate data to compute cumulative probability functions of yield to provide evidence regarding viability for a particular ecotope. It is concluded that the relevant technology and knowledge available in South Africa are adequate for the task ahead. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa;Lesotho ### Plant products search: maize ### Measurements for crops: maize ### Topics keywords: SA;food insecurity;drought stress;long term ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA;IBRD",2012,,Irrigation and Drainage,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ird.1688,,#37009,,"",Observational
Pest management in small farms.,"","Abstract: The occurrence of pre-harvest pests on food crops and the potential management of these pests are influenced by a complex of factors, especially by currently prevailing agricultural practices. This is illustrated by a case-study of the relatively recent outbreaks of Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), and associated pests and diseases, in rice in Indonesia. The study shows that increased problems associated with this pest, and occasionally also Nephotettix spp. and Sogatella furcifera (Horv.), are associated with increases in average rice yields (resulting from improved husbandry, the growing of high-yielding susceptible cultivars, the use of nitrogen fertilizers, and improved irrigation and water management) in lowland areas where temperatures are suitable for population growth of Nilaparvata lugens. ### Countries mentioned: Indonesia ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;food safety;insect pest ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1982,,Protection Ecology,,,,,,,#37445,,"",Experimental; Observational
"Performance of cassava (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Manihot esculanta</i>. Cratz) clones in potential and low moisture stressed areas of Ethiopia.","","Abstract: Cassava (. Cratz) is one of the most important food crops that constitute a considerable portion of the daily diet of the people and also serves as one of the major source of carbohydrate. Despite its importance, production of cassava in Ethiopia has different constraints and opportunities. Among which, shortage of improved varieties is the first and the most important one. It is mainly cultivated by small resource poor farmers on smallholding plots of land. Average storage root yield obtained per a given plot of cassava is as low as 100 tons per hectare despite the potential yield of 600 tons per hectare per year. This low yield might be due to the cultivation of local, low yielding, late maturing cultivars. To contribute to alleviating the problem and provide farmers other alternative varieties, Hawassa Agricultural Research Center, in collaboration with Jimma and Sekota Agricultural Research Centers, conducted evaluation of cassava clones in potential and moisture stressed agroclimatic conditions of the country. Jima and Hawassa sites represent potential agroclimatic condition, while Amaro and Sekota represent moisture stressed areas. A total of seven cassava clones namely AWC-1 (MM 96/5280), AWC-2 (MM 90/5280), AWC-3 (MM 96/7151), AWC-4 (MM96/1871), AWC-5 (MM96/3868) and Kello (standard check) were evaluated by using randomized complete block design replicated three times. The evaluation was carried out for two consecutive years, from 2012 to 2014. The combined analysis result indicated that there was statistically significant difference among the clones tested and the locations where the experiment was conducted. The clone AWC-1 (37.17 t/ha) followed by AWC-2(35.52 t/ha) and AWC-5 (35.51 t/ha) gave the highest storage root yield but there was no statistically significant difference in the total storage yield among the clones AWC-2, AWC-3 and AWC- 5. In the same way, the highest dry matter content was recorded from the clones AWC-2 (51.8%), AWC-3 (48.5%) and Kello (49.1%). Among the locations tested, the best result was obtained from Amaro (35.14 t/ha) which is characterized by its low moisture stress, indicating that cassava can resist/tolerate low moisture stress and give comparative yield provided that other factors are not limited. Thus, those clones with the highest storage root yield and dry matter content were promoted for variety verification and will be released for wider production. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: cassava ### Measurements for crops: cassava ### Topics keywords: experiment conducted;plant height;DM;growing season;significant difference;drip irrigation;randomized complete block design;dry matter;flow rate;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2017,,African Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5897/AJAR2016.11365,,#37318,,"",Experimental
Plant Selection and Performance of Two Cattle Types and Camels on Semiarid Rangelands in Kenya,"","Abstract: Plant selection pattern and performance of lactating cattle and camels were compared on semiarid savanna rangelands in Kenya in the rainy season (RS) and a transition period (TP) between the RS and the main dry season. It was further evaluated whether supplementation with rumen-degradable protein (RDP) had an effect on these parameters. In both seasons, two cattle types (local 'Pokot' cattle and Guernsey x Boran crossbreds) and camels were used, with six females per treatment group (supplemented and nonsupplemented) each (n = 72 animals in total). The experimental periods consisted of 8-10 d of adaptation and 36-40 d of data and sample collection. The diet selected by the cattle types was similar and consisted almost exclusively of grasses. The camel diet consisted mainly of herbs and shrubs with higher contributions of woody plants in the TP than in the RS. Forage from woody plants overall made up a higher proportion of the diet, which was also reflected by a longer browsing time (overall and in the TP) of the supplemented camels compared with the nonsupplemented camels. This result indicates that supplementation of browsers like camels with RDP can be used to increase the intake of forage from woody plants rich in plant secondary compounds, which could be an effective measure for managing rangeland to limit bush encroachment. Overall, no seasonal differences in milk yield were found for the camels and Pokot cattle, but crossbreds had a lower yield in the TP compared with the RS. Overall, the cattle had higher milk fat content than the camels while the camels had slightly higher protein content. Supplementation had no effect on milk yield and composition. The results of diet selection and performance (milk yield) reflect the advantage of camels in arid rangelands. ### Countries mentioned: Guernsey;Kenya ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: recombination detection program (RDP);rural development (RD) program;ribosomal database project (RDP);rural development (RD) project ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;remote sensing;chemical composition;RS;sweet potato;protein content;tillage practice;bulk density;rice straw;agroforestry system;dry season;RDP;NT;small scale;total phosphorus;total porosity;TP;rural development;dairy cattle;family farming;food insecurity;spatial distribution;crop residue;GIS;human activity ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2018,,RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2018.04.007,,#36762,,"",Experimental
Preliminary identification on drought resistance of alfalfa varieties and new line MS-LM01.,"","Abstract: In order to elucidate drought resistance of alfalfa new lineMS-LM01, pot culture and water control were used to imitate drought stress. Three water treatments were set up to study the morphological and physiological characteristic responses of different alfalfa varieties. This study indicated that the increase of soil drought conditions resulted in the decreases of plant height, root width, biomass, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate, whereas proline content was increased. In comparison, plant height, biomass, root width, relative water content, net photosynthetic rate and proline content of MS-LM01 in light stress (LS) and severe stress (SS) were less sensitive to drought stress Comprehensive subordinate function value analysis suggested that drought resistant order was Longdong &gt; MS-LM01 &gt; Gannong No. 3 &gt; Golden Empress &gt; Zhongmu No. 1. The results showed that the new line MS-LM01 had strong drought resistance and better agronomic performance, which was of great significance to the selection of alfalfa varieties and the breeding of drought-resistant alfalfa varieties in arid area. ### Plant products search: alfalfa ### Topics keywords: livelihood strategy;CAP;plant height;drought stress;rural household;dairy industry;EU;market share;SS;rural development;member state;sewage sludge",2017,,Journal of Southwest University for Nationalities - Natural Science Edition,,,,,,,#36434,,"",Experimental
Novel sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane to minimise soil evaporation,"","Abstract: Sprayable film systems for soil to prevent moisture loss have received increased attention as next generation alternatives to the use of preformed films. In this paper we report on the properties of a novel water dispersible, sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane and results of preliminary pot and field trials using this membrane to minimise soil evaporation. The polymer emulsion contains 40 wt% solid content with particle sizes in the 100-500 micron range and its viscosity is 400±70 mPa.s; it is stable at ambient temperature and can be sprayed using standard farm equipment. The small scale pot trial indicated a 10-50% reduction in soil evaporation across a number of different soils. The field trial, on a Hanwood loam soil showed that the polymer membrane treatment maintained approximately the same crop yield compared to the control, but used 28% less irrigation water. Water use productivity was 0.34 to 0.46 kg/100 L higher in the polymer treatment than in the control treatments, representing a 20-30% increase in water productivity. Refinement of the polymer membrane together with further field testing is ongoing. ### Measurements for interventions: water productivity ### Topics keywords: small scale;particle size;bulk density;moisture content",2015,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Technologies for Sustainable Development, ICTSD 2015",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTSD.2015.7095875,,#37218,,Balsher Sidhu (2019-06-18 11:34:38)(Screen): doesn't mention smallholders or any specific LMIC; ,Experimental
Okra performance and soil and water conservation as influenced by poultry manure and organic mulch amendments.,"","Abstract: There is growing interest in intensive dry season vegetable crop cultivation by peasant farmers in south eastern Nigeria, but little research information to guide them on appropriate soil and water management for restoring, replenishing, conserving and maintaining soil fertility for optimum profit on their fragile soils. A two-year field experiment was conducted during the dry seasons of 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 on the acidic coastal plain soils at Calabar, to evaluate various rates of poultry manure (PM) (0, 5, 10 and 15 t/ha) and organic mulch (0, 2, 4 and 6 t/ha) for optimum yield of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) and their combined effect on weed growth and soil chemical and physical properties. The PM and mulch application reduced soil bulk density, increased soil moisture retention capacity and lowered weed infestation. They also raised the soil pH, organic matter content, total N, available P and exchangeable K, Ca and Mg status of the soil. The growth and fresh pod yield of okra peaked at 10 t/ha PM and 4 t/ha mulch rates. These rates increased fresh pod weight by 94 and 57% and mean fresh pod yield by 160 and 115%, respectively, compared with the unamended control plots. Poultry manure at 10 t/ha plus 4 t/ha organic mulch had the best effects on soil bulk density reduction and fresh pod yield of okra. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Plant products search: okras;out of season vegetables ### Animal products search: poultry meat ### Measurements for interventions: control plot;pod;manure ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;experiment conducted;cropping system;soil fertility;SM;dry matter;sweet potato;NPK;bulk density;TN;net return;winter wheat;drip irrigation;NH4;moisture content;weed infestation;field experiment;dry season;agroforestry system;NO3;flow rate;poultry manure;small scale;DM;significant difference;physical property;TP;dairy cattle;field experiment conducted;organic matter;organic fertilizer;food insecurity;plant height;spatial distribution;organic matter content;OM;growing season;soil moisture;weed control;FYM;crop residue;human activity;DAS;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,"Journal of Food, Agriculture & Environment",,,,,,,#36881,,"",Experimental
On-farm evaluation of fertilizer briquettes and low-cost drip irrigation for smallholder vegetable production in Cambodia.,"","Abstract: The performance of low cost drip irrigation (LCDI) compared to hand watering (HW), as well as NPK fertilizer briquette deep placement (FBDP) compared to conventional compound fertilizer (CCF), for vegetable production was evaluated. Yield and water use efficiency (WUE) increased significantly with LCDI compared to HW on cucumber (13 and 41%), sponge gourd (85 and 129%), eggplant (38 and 113%), bitter gourd (121 and 35%) and long bean (5 and 27%) respectively. Yield and WUE of cucumber (22 and 25%) and long bean (9% and 12%) increased with FBDP compared to CCF. Net income due to FBDP was greater by 24 and 14% for cucumber and long bean, respectively, compared to CCF. The number of man-days employed for irrigation increased six times in HW compared to LCDI. Net return with LCDI was greater by 52% compared to HW and varied from 4 to 121% between the crops. Combined over two trials, yield and WUE increased by 37% (5.589 vs 4.065 Mg ha-1) and 123% (4.28 vs 1.916 Mg ML-1) respectively, with less applied water in LCDI compared to HW (1.687 vs 2.78 ML ha-1). LCDI and FBDP can significantly improve yield, WUE and profitability of the small-scale vegetable growers in Cambodia. ### Countries mentioned: Cambodia ### Plant products search: eggplants;grain legumes;cucumbers ### Measurements for interventions: ML ### Topics keywords: small scale;net income;NP;net return;WUE;weed control;drip irrigation;hand weeding;use efficiency;economic benefit;DAS;NPK;NPK fertilizer ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2011,,Irrigation and Drainage,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/ird.571,,#37015,,"",Experimental

Opportunities and needs in development of smallholder goat production systems in Africa.,"","Abstract: A detailed diagnosis of the dynamics of smallholder goat farming systems will guide in any of livelihood intervention programs which takes into account the important socioeconomic issues towards improving the standard of living of the rural poor in Africa. Goats provide smallholder resource poor farmers with a vast range of products and services such as immediate cash income, meat, milk, skin, manure, risk spreading/management and social functions. This is on the background that goats require smaller investments, have shorter production cycles and greater environmental adaptability, and hence have a unique niche in smallholder agriculture which make them a sustainable enterprise in the context of climate change and variability. This is a review paper that explores the feasibility of goat production as an viable option to improve the quality of life of rural populations in Africa. The discussion highlights the opportunities and challenges in maximizing goat production on the continent focusing on the reducing the current animal product demand supply gap in rural areas. Empirical evidence show that goat population do play a greater role in smallholder farming sector and the species is increasing in numbers than other livestock. The major concern for using goats is their ecological and physiological adaptive traits which will be more important in the context of climate change variability and other common environmental shocks. The factors which contribute to efficiency in goat production as influenced by water stress, feed inadequacy and disease resistance should be studied further in-order for goats to continually survive the extremities of climate change. Study conclude that goats constitute an important reservoir of genetic material and sustainable form of animal production that has significant potential for alleviating malnutrition and food insecurity in Africa. ### Animal products search: meat;milk ### Programs found: intervention program;livelihood intervention program;interventional program ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;cover crop;climate change;CC;take account;soil fertility;point view;taking account;smallholder farming;taken account;smallholder farmer;farming system;rural area",2014,,Scientific Journal of Animal Science,,,,,,,#37442,,"",Observational
Perceptions of the effects of floods and droughts on livelihoods: lessons from arid Kenya,"","Abstract: Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to understand how people practicing natural resource-based livelihoods in arid Kenya perceive that their livelihoods are being affected by floods and droughts and how to integrate these local perceptions of impacts into larger-scale climate change adaptation initiatives and policy. Design/methodology/approach-In Isiolo County, Kenya, 270 households were surveyed in seven communities, six focus group discussions were held and a document review was conducted. Findings-The major livelihood practiced in Isiolo is pastoralism (71 per cent), but agriculture and non-agro-pastoral activities also play an important role, with 53 per cent of the respondents practicing more than one type of livelihood. In Isiolo, floods have a large impact on agriculture (193 respondents out of 270), while droughts impact both agriculture (104 respondents) and livestock (120 respondents), and more specifically, cattle-keeping (70 respondents). Research limitations/implications-The research may have implications for the importance of using local perceptions of the effects of climate change on livelihoods for larger-scale interventions. It also provides a case study of local perceptions of the effects of floods and droughts on livelihoods in an arid area with natural resource-dependent livelihoods. Practical implications-To understand local perceptions and use local perceptions for larger-scale adaptation interventions and policy. Originality/value-This paper provides a specific example of a climate change adaptation initiative integrating local perceptions of the impacts of floods and droughts into livelihood-focused interventions. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Programs found: climate change adaptation (CCA) initiative;adaptation initiative ### Topics keywords: cover crop;climate change;natural resource;play important role;crop insurance;supply chain;human health;rural community;cent respondent;originality value;large scale;dairy farming;climate change adaptation;design methodology approach;CC ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2017,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJCCSM-11-2014-0132,,#36298,,"",Observational
Photovoltaic water pumping systems for horticultural crops irrigation: Advancements and opportunities towards a green energy strategy for Mozambique,"","Abstract: In developing countries, as in Mozambique's case, with about 28.8 million inhabitants, 70% does not have access to the conventional electricity network and 80% depends on agriculture for their subsistence, however, only 5% of the cultivated area is irrigated, and only 1% of the energy from the grid is destined for agriculture. The low index of the population with access to electricity leads to the development of affordable and clean energy for agricultural and domestic uses in accordance with the second and seventh objective of the sustainable development goals. Photovoltaic water pumping systems (PVWPS) have been widely used to increase access to energy for irrigation in many countries and several tools’ design are being developed to improve their performance and deployment. However, during the PVWPS design, many of existing tools somehow fail by considering the water demand as a constant throughout crops productive cycle. In this paper, a qualitative analysis of horticultural crops water demand on PVWPS design for irrigation is made. The advancements and opportunities of Mozambique in the adoption of PVWPS for irrigation are also made, exploring the best perspective of transition for Mozambique green energy strategy needs. From the qualitative analysis, the results show that the water demand of horticultural crops is dynamic throughout the productive cycle, which allows a surplus of electrical energy after the irrigation that can be saved and possibly redirected to cover other electrical energy needs. Mozambique has favorable conditions in that regards to the available weather conditions and renewable policy framework in general, in addition to other existent favorable conditions. The Mozambican government may adopt PVWPS for horticultural crops irrigation as a strategy to increase access to energy for irrigation, and as an alternative energy source in order to minimize the high rates of lack of access to energy. ### Countries mentioned: Mozambique ### Topics keywords: developing country;sustainable development;growing season;weather condition;SDG;sustainable development goal ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2019,,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seta.2019.03.004,,#36214,,"",Observational

Productivity limits and potentials of the principles of conservation agriculture,"","Abstract: One of the primary challenges of our time is to feed a growing and more demandingworld population with reduced external inputs and minimal environmental impacts, allundermore variable and extreme climate conditions in the future1-4. Conservation agriculture represents a set of three crop management principles that has received strong international support to help address this challenge5,6, with recent conservation agriculture efforts focusing on smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia7.However, conservationagriculture is highly debated, with respect to both its effects on crop yields8-10 andits applicability in different farming contexts7,11-13. Here we conduct a globalmeta-analysis using 5,463 paired yield observations from610 studies to compare no-till, the original and central concept of conservation agriculture, with conventional tillage practices across 48 crops and 63 countries. Overall, our results show that no-till reduces yields, yet this response is variable and under certain conditions no-till can produce equivalent or greater yields than conventional tillage. Importantly,whenno-till is combined with the other two conservation agriculture principles of residue retention and crop rotation, its negative impacts are minimized. Moreover, no-till in combination with the other two principles significantly increases rainfed cropproductivity indry climates, suggesting that itmaybecome animportant climate-change adaptation strategy for ever-drier regions of the world. However, any expansion of conservation agriculture should be done with caution in these areas, as implementation of the other two principles is often challenging in resource-poor and vulnerable smallholder farming systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of yield losses rather than gains. Although farming systems are multifunctional, and environmental and socio-economic factors need to be considered14-16, our analysis indicates that the potential contribution of no-till to the sustainable intensification of agriculture is more limited than often assumed. ### Topics keywords: adaptation strategy;CA;soil fertility;rural community;factor affecting;CC;tillage practice;SSA;environmental impact;conventional tillage;smallholder farming;farming system;NT;crop rotation;residue retention;climate change adaptation;food security;cover crop;climate change;sustainable intensification;smallholder farmer;CT;negative impact ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2015,,Nature,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13809,,#36614,,"",Experimental; Meta-Analysis; Observational
Rain water harvesting and ground water recharging in North Western Himalayan region for sustainable agricultural productivity.,"","Abstract: This paper reveals the study of low cost traditional water harvesting structures that helps in improving the socio-economic status of the poor farmers of the hill region. In the foothill region of North Western Himalayan region of India, the soil erosion has converted most of the fertile soils into barren, fallow and degraded lands. It is estimated that about 40 per cent of the total geographical area of Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and Jammu and Kashmir is highly degraded. Soil loss through erosion is about 3.6 to 80 t ha. The farmers are not aware of rainwater management for storage and ground water recharge. The major constraints identified for conservation and management of water and soil in the area includes lack of technical knowledge and poor economic status of the farmers. Assessment of the area showed that if rainwater is conserved vis-à-vis managed properly and existing technologies are refined for specific land and pedospheric characteristics, it would rehabilitate the degraded lands and in turn increase the productivity in the area. Low cost farm ponds are a better option for collecting rainwater excess during monsoon periods for utilization for irrigation. The most efficient and cheapest way of conserving rainwater at the agricultural farm was found to be in- situ runoff management, which also reduces soil losses and increases the opportunity time for ground water recharging. The earthen embankment for rainwater harvesting has cost benefit ratio of 1.38:1. In addition, good results of harvesting and storage are being achieved in ferro-cement water storage structures of different dimensions of 3 to 5 m deep and 1 to 3 m in diameter. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Topics keywords: degraded land;soil erosion;net return;land degradation ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2011,,Universal Journal of Environmental Research and Technology,,,,,,,#36425,,"",Experimental
"On-farm evaluation of soil and water conservation practices on hillsides in Mexico, Nicaragua and Honduras.","","Abstract: The paper describes a three-year collaborative project involving small-farm technology oriented research groups in Mexico, Nicaragua and Honduras. The project focused on hill-farming communities in the three countries from 1990 to 1993 and followed a methodical process approach, starting with exploratory surveys involving informal farmer interviews and collection of secondary information. Subsequent stages included: hypothesis formulation; formal surveys; selection of representative collaborating farmers; technology selection and on-farm evaluation. An analysis of the farming systems identified soil and water conservation as an important technical concern amongst farmers. A major constraint experienced by all the farmers was scarcity of capital and also of labour at critical times of the year. Therefore, in the process of the selection of technologies to alleviate the technical problems, due attention had to be given to reducing the requirements for these two production factors to a minimum. To enhance the probability of successful adoption, techniques adopted by farmers in other parts of the world were assessed and discussed as options before resorting to technology development. The principal successful technologies assessed were: live contour-barriers (of vetiver grass [Vetiveria zizanioides]; Gliricidia sepium; pigeon pea [Cajanus cajan]; Pennisetum spp. grasses); leguminous cover cropping with velvet bean (Mucuna spp); single equine-powered chisel-plough.

A comparative economic analysis of goat production systems in Jordan with an emphasis on water use.,"","Abstract: Goat production is an integral part of farming systems in Jordan and can play an important role in poverty alleviation and improved food security in rural households. Water provision is a crucial input for animal productivity. This study aims to assess the economic performance of goat production in different production systems in southern Jordan, with an emphasis on water use. Data were collected from a total of 120 purposely selected goat keepers from June to October 2012 using a survey based on structured questionnaires. Indicators for the economic performance of goat production were gross margin (GM), benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and net benefit (NB). Results showed that goats were mainly kept to generate cash income from sales of surplus milk and live animals. In both systems (=114 farmers), feed shared the highest costs (75%) of the total variable costs, followed by transportation of water and feed (12%), labor (9%), veterinary services (4%) and water (0.2%). Total variable costs per flock were significantly (&lt;0.05) higher in the transhumant than in the sedentary system. The significantly longer distance associated with high fuel and labor costs to fetch water from water source sites in the transhumant system resulted in a significant (&lt;0.05) higher cost of transportation per flock compared to the sedentary system. The economic performance parameters were similar between production systems. A 28% of farmers in the transhumant system and 11% of farmers in the sedentary system had a negative NB. Production system, flock size, fertility rate, feeding intensity and productivity rate showed a significant (&lt;0.05) impact on GM1, while only flock size and fertility rate had a significant (&lt;0.05) impact on GM2 and NB. Further investigations of effects of water use on the profitability and thus on the sustainability of goat farming under more extensive production systems are recommended. Moreover, improvement of goat reproductive management and flock health are required to improve economic efficiency of goat production. ### Countries mentioned: Jordan;Canada;Gambia ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for interventions: labor cost ### Topics keywords: organic farming;veterinary service;soil fertility;sweet potato;green manure;gross margin;play important role;net return;poverty alleviation;rural household;taking account;genetic modification;farming system;beef cattle;GM;small scale;crop rotation;human health;non GM;cost ratio;rural development;farm size;nutrient balance;animal health;food security;organic fertilizer;cover crop ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: IDA;IBRD;Low-income countries(995$ or less);Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2015,,Livestock Research for Rural Development,,,,,,,#36228,,"",Observational

Potential Use of Halophytes and Salt Tolerant Plants in Ruminant Feeding: A Tunisian Case Study,"","Abstract: This review summarizes the main results of studies related to the fodder potential of some halophytes and salt-tolerant species in Tunisia and highlights the main constraints and opportunities for better valorizing them in ruminant feeding. In Tunisian livestock extensive systems, small ruminant herds, mobility and productivity are severely affected by several devastating factors, such as overgrazing and mismanagement of pasture, in addition to climate changes inducing frequent drought periods and soil salinization. Considering this alarming situation, new strategies and practices are being developed and applied with the aim to promote sustainable management of natural resources and to enhance livestock production. In connection with this, several native or cultivated fodder species such as xerophytes and halophytes could play an important role in the rehabilitation of pasture and the feeding of ruminants in saline lands and/or in arid and semi-arid regions, thereby increasing rural incomes and improving the livelihood of smallholder farmers. The main importance of these plants is their capacity to produce considerable amounts of biomass on saline soils and during drought conditions. The major limitations to be considered when planning halophyte plantation and/or exploitation are high salt (limiting intake and digestibility of the diet) and plant secondary metabolites, moderate energy value, low levels of biomass production and the possibility of inducing mineral imbalances. Most of these feedstuffs are best considered as a supplement rather than forage to be fed as a sole diet. Several strategies to valorize halophytes in ruminant feeding, such as (i) free grazing or cut and carry with supplementation (ii) mixing them with other fodders in shrub mixed diet (iii) using them as alternative feed supplements (iii) and (iv) in alley-cropping to supplement cereal stubble have been reported. ### Countries mentioned: Tunisia ### Plant products search: cereals ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;small ruminant;cover crop;climate change;natural resource;play important role;human health;secondary metabolite;animal health;smallholder farmer;medicinal plant;farming system;CC ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2016,,"HALOPHYTIC AND SALT-TOLERANT FEEDSTUFFS: IMPACTS ON NUTRITION, PHYSIOLOGY AND REPRODUCTION OF LIVESTOCK",,,,,,,#36999,,"",Observational
Potential value of GCM-based seasonal rainfall forecasts for maize management in semi-arid Kenya [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: We estimate the potential value of general circulation model (GCM)-based seasonal precipitation forecasts for maize planting and fertilizer management decisions at two semi-arid locations (Katumani and Makindu) in Southern Kenya. Analyses combine downscaled rainfall forecasts, crop yield simulation, stochastic enterprise budgeting and identification of profit-maximizing fertilizer N rates and stand densities. October-February rainfall predictions were downscaled from a GCM, run with both observed and forecast sea surface temperature boundary conditions - representing upper and lower bounds of predictability - and stochastically disaggregated into daily crop model inputs. Simulated interactive effects of rainfall, N supply and stand density on yield and profit are consistent with literature. Perfect foreknowledge of daily weather for the growing season would be worth an estimated 15-30% of the average gross value of production and 24-69% of average gross margin, depending on location and on whether household labor is included in cost calculations. GCM predictions based on observed sea surface temperatures increased average gross margins 24% at Katumani and 9% at Makindu when labor cost was included. At the lead time used, forecasts using forecast sea surface temperatures are not skillful and showed near-zero value. Forecast value was much more sensitive to grain price than to input costs. Stochastic dominance analysis shows that farmers at any level of risk aversion would prefer the forecast-based management strategy over management optimized for climatology under the study's assumptions, despite high probability (25% at Katumani, 34% at Makindu) of lower returns in individual years. Results contribute to knowledge of seasonal forecast value in a relatively high-risk, high-predictability context; utility and value of forecasts derived from a GCM; and risk implications of smallholder farmers responding to forecasts. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Measurements for interventions: labor cost ### Topics keywords: small scale;short term;crop rotation;gross margin;growing season;NH4;taking account;non GM;NO3;farm size;sweet potato;smallholder farmer;commodity price;beef cattle;GM ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2009,,Agricultural systems,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44208182&site=ehost-live,,#37381,,"",Modeling
Producing more food with less water in a changing world: Assessment of water productivity in 10 major river basins,"","Abstract: This article summarizes the results of water productivity assessment in 10 river basins across Asia, Africa and South America, representing a range of agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Intensive farming in the Asian basins gives much greater agricultural outputs and higher water productivity. Largely subsistence agriculture in Africa has significantly lower water productivity. There is very high intra-basin variability, which is attributed mainly to lack of inputs, and poor water and crop management. Closing gaps between ""bright spots"" and the poorly performing areas are the major tasks for better food security and improved livelihoods, which have to be balanced with environmental sustainability. ### Topics keywords: land degradation;rural community;food security",2011,,Water International,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2011.542403,,#37459,,"",Meta-Analysis; Observational
Smallholder adoption of soil and water conservation techniques in Ghana.,"","Abstract: At the onset of climate change, the adoption of soil and water conservation (SWC) techniques in Africa sub of the Sahara has become even more crucial. The study aimed at estimating the determinants and effects of SWC adoption. The data was obtained from the Ghana Agriculture Production Survey (GAPS), a national level survey conducted by Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture with technical and financial support from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). A total sample size of 1,530 farm households selected from 20 districts across Ghana was used. The Poisson model was employed to estimate the determinants of adoption of SWC technology while the stochastic frontier model was used to analyze the effects of SWC technology adoption on technical efficiency. The study found that SWC adoption significantly affected technical efficiency in maize production. Significant policy variables that were found to positively influence the adoption of SWC techniques included credit, farm size, group membership and proximity to input sale points. Also, credit, education and extension services significantly influenced farmers' technical efficiency. There is the need for a holist approach to supporting farmers. In general, access to education, extension services and credit must be stepped up. Farmers must also be supported to form farm groups as a viable source of farm labour. ### Countries mentioned: Ghana ### Plant products search: maize ### Topics keywords: stochastic frontier;cover crop;climate change;CAP;CC;survey conducted;management practice;used analyze;financial support;technology adoption;farm size;extension service;FAO;smallholder farmer;social capital;factor affecting;technical efficiency ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2014,,African Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,,,#36577,,"",Observational
"Socio-economic impact of modern vegetable production technology in the royal project, Thailand","","Abstract: The people living in the remote highland areas of northern Thailand are desperately poor. The predominant agricultural practice is shifting cultivation: to slash and burn the forest to grow opium poppy, upland rice and maize. Not unexpectedly, this rapidly depletes the forest area and has significant implications for erosion and sustainable watershed management. In 1969, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej saw the possibility of replacing opium poppy farms with other cash crops using more environmentally friendly farming practices. This initiative came to be known as the Royal Project. The Royal Project Foundation now has 4 research centres and 38 agricultural development stations in the five Northern provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phayao, Lumphun and Mae Hong Son. The Project has introduced more than 140 different kinds of vegetables and now supports over 3,000 households covering an area of 1,200 ha. The Royal Project has emphasized modern technology, the use of F1 hybrid seed, post-harvest technology, GAP and GMP, protected cultivation and fertigation, to increase the yield and quality per unit area. From five selected stations, the farmers participating in the Royal Project have achieved an average annual income of Bht 100,064/household, which is substantially higher than the national average annual farm income of Bht 39,193/household. ### Countries mentioned: Thailand ### Plant products search: maize;opium;rice;vegetables ### Programs found: royal project;practice initiative;granary area program (GAP) ### Measurements for crops: vegetables ### Topics keywords: post harvest;organic farming;land degradation;insect pest;annual income;sweet potato;rural household;shifting cultivation;agroforestry system;farming practice;farming system;GAP;food safety;management practice;cover crop;land use;cash crop;dairy farming;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2009,,Acta Horticulturae,,,,,,,#37591,,"",""

The development of integrated crop/livestock production in the low-rainfall areas of Western Asia and North Africa: overview and achievements of the Mashreq-Maghreb Project.,"","Abstract: Focusing on an integrated crop/livestock farming system, the work of the Mashreq/Maghreb project is described. The project was initiated in January 1995 with support from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development, in order to promote the development of sustainable livestock-based systems through the integration of crop and livestock production. The development objective is that through the integration of crop and livestock production both within and across production systems, productive and sustainable livestock-based systems can be developed. This would improve the incomes and welfare of small farmers and livestock owners in the low rainfall areas of Western Asia and North Africa, while meeting national demand for livestock products, and conserving the natural resource base in the rangeland. Issues discussed are: the required action; project objectives; the project mission; the project's stakeholders; project collaborators; project approaches; the development of work plans; implementation of the work plan; and project components. Achievements of the project in the Mashreq countries are described as: an improvement in barley production; forage-legume crop improvement; improvement in the reproductive physiology of sheep; improvements in feed utilization; technology transfer; training and education; and project publications. ### Plant products search: legumes;barley ### Animal products search: livestock products ### Programs found: maghreb project;plant project;collaboration project;development objective project;education project;project objective project mission project;stakeholder project ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;animal welfare;natural resource;dairy farming;livestock farming;point view;crop residue;animal health;farming system;beef cattle ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa",1997,,Development in Western Asia;Agriculture &amp,,,,,,,#36624,,"",Observational
Preliminary identification on drought resistance of alfalfa varieties and new line MS-LM01.,"","Abstract: In order to elucidate drought resistance of alfalfa new lineMS-LM01, pot culture and water control were used to imitate drought stress. Three water treatments were set up to study the morphological and physiological characteristic responses of different alfalfa varieties. This study indicated that the increase of soil drought conditions resulted in the decreases of plant height, root width, biomass, leaf relative water content, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate, whereas proline content was increased. In comparison, plant height, biomass, root width, relative water content, net photosynthetic rate and proline content of MS-LM01 in light stress (LS) and severe stress (SS) were less sensitive to drought stress Comprehensive subordinate function value analysis suggested that drought resistant order was Longdong &gt; MS-LM01 &gt; Gannong No. 3 &gt; Golden Empress &gt; Zhongmu No. 1. The results showed that the new line MS-LM01 had strong drought resistance and better agronomic performance, which was of great significance to the selection of alfalfa varieties and the breeding of drought-resistant alfalfa varieties in arid area. ### Plant products search: alfalfa ### Topics keywords: livelihood strategy;CAP;plant height;drought stress;rural household;dairy industry;EU;market share;SS;rural development;member state;sewage sludge",2017,,Journal of Southwest University for Nationalities - Natural Science Edition,,,,,,,#37021,,"",Experimental
Pressurized irrigation technologies for smallholders in developing countries - a review.,"","Abstract: The findings of a study of factors influencing the uptake of pressurized irrigation technologies by smallholders in developing countries are presented. The paper reviews the physical and technical characteristics that determine their suitability for use by smallholders. It also identifies a range of pre-conditions relating to water availability, institutional support and economic opportunity that must be satisfied before smallholders will adopt even 'low-technology' pressurized irrigation systems. The review demonstrates that where physical, economic and institutional conditions are right some forms of pressurized 'modern' irrigation technology permit smallholder irrigation of high value crops where surface irrigation would be inappropriate. However, the paper warns against the danger of wide-scale promotion of such technologies without considering the issues of institutional and technical support. Where pressurized systems are promoted to increase water use efficiency it is essential that they be well designed, installed and operated for savings to be realised. ### Topics keywords: developing country;drip irrigation;use efficiency;factor influencing;WUE",1998,,Irrigation and Drainage Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1006037817381,,#36611,,"",Observational; Systematic Review
Rainfed agriculture and food security in dry areas,"","Abstract: The world’s ability to produce enough food to feed the growing population is further constrained by water scarcity, particularly in dry areas. Water is an increasingly scarce resource and the FAO estimates that nearly 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water- scarcity by 2025. The problem faced by people and countries in dry areas amounts to more than resource scarcity. It is a combination of resource limitations, land and water degradation, and the low efficiency of resource use. Under conditions of resource limitations in dry areas - particularly water - future increases in productivity and production for improving food security and ensuring environmental quality, need to come from enhancing the efficiency of resource-use - rather than using more inputs or increasing the food production area. The challenges of feeding the growing population under the conditions of climate changes, shortages of water for irrigated agriculture and degradation of arable land are increasing the demand to improve grain production from rainfed areas. The contribution of rainfed farming to food security in dryland countries can be substantially enhanced through increased adoption of currently available technologies supported by enabling policy and institutional environments. Rainfed farming can contribute more significantly to achieve new targets of food security if desired investment levels are realized. On-farm results show the huge potential for improving land and water productivity and profitability of smallholder rainfed agriculture. Yield gap in rainfed crops remain large enough to suggest considerable scope for increasing achievable yields. Applied agricultural research-for-development suggests the following strategies for producing more food with less resources, particularly in rainfed areas of developing countries which are characterized by resource-poor small-holder farming systems: closing the yield gap of rainfed crops, enhancing adoption of improved technologies, promoting sustainable intensification and diversification of production systems, strengthening innovation systems, reducing vulnerability and managing risk, encouraging the use of water saving technologies, informing policy development, and increasing investment in agricultural research and development.Advances in science to produce improved and higher-performing crops and livestock hold exciting prospects for making dryland food production systems more efficient, and more resistant to climatic pressures and new pests and diseases. This chapter illustrates the huge potential of technological innovation to improve food security, but also the need for supportive policies and institutions to encourage farmers to adopt these innovations. ### Plant products search: grain ### Topics keywords: cover crop;arable land;climate change;developing country;sustainable intensification;CA;water saving;irrigated agriculture;CC;use efficiency;water scarcity;yield gap;FAO;smallholder farmer;farming system;management practice;long term;food security",2017,,"Water, Energy and Food Sustainability in the Middle East: The Sustainability Triangle",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48920-9_14,,#36327,,"",""

Reducing food poverty by increasing agricultural sustainability in developing countries,"","Abstract: We examined the extent to which farmers have improved food production in recent years with low cost, locally available and environmentally sensitive practices and technologies. We analysed by survey during 1999-2000 208 projects in 52 developing countries, in which 8.98 million farmers have adopted these practices and technologies on 28.92 million hectares, representing 3.0% of the 960 million hectares of arable and permanent crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We found improvements in food production occurring through one or more of four mechanisms: (i) intensification of a single component of farm system; (ii) addition of a new productive element to a farm system; (iii) better use of water and land, so increasing cropping intensity; (iv) improvements in per hectare yields of staples through introduction of new regenerative elements into farm systems and new locally appropriate crop varieties and animal breeds. The 89 projects with reliable yield data show an average per project increase in per hectare food production of 93%. The weighted average increases across these projects were 37% per farm and 48% per hectare. In the 80 projects with small (<5 ha) farms where cereals were the main staples, the 4.42 million farms on 3.58 million hectares increased household food production by 1.71 t per year. We report on the practices and technologies that have led to these increases: increased water use efficiency, improvements to soil health and fertility, and pest control with minimal or zero-pesticide use. This research reveals promising advances in the adoption of practices and technologies that are likely to be more sustainable, with substantial benefits for the rural poor. With further explicit support, particularly through national policy reforms and better markets, these improvements in food security could spread to much larger numbers of farmers and rural people in the coming decades. ### Plant products search: cereals ### Programs found: project farmer (PF) ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;million hectare;arable land;developing country;household food security;drip irrigation;use efficiency;pest control;WUE;food security ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean",2003,,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8809(02)00087-7,,#36268,,"",Systematic Review
Response of five food legume crops to an irrigation gradient imposed during reproductive growth.,"","Abstract: Food legumes, an excellent source of protein and soil fertility improvement, offer small farmers a means of intensifying cropping on rice lands in semiarid and tropical regions. Unfortunately food legume productivity is often limited by variation in the amount and distribution of rainfall. The study was conducted to compare differential responses of mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) to a soil water gradient imposed during the reproductive growth phase. Field studies were conducted on Lipa clay loam, an isohyperthemic Typic Hapludoll silt loam soil, using a line source sprinkler irrigation system at the International Rice Research Institute, Philippines, from January to May during 1985 and 1986. Among the five species, peanut yielded significantly higher across the irrigation regimes in both years. Lack of water in the driest regime (50% water deficit replacement) reduced the seed yield of mungbean, soybean, cowpea, and peanut by an average of 43, 39, 34, and 32%, respectively. However, pigeonpea seed yield increased by an average of 31% in the driest regime. Seed yield increases per mm of total irrigation water plus rainfall were 3.46 and 5.61 kg ha-1 in soybean, and 3.55 to 5.67 kg ha-1 in peanut in 1985 and 1986, respectively. However, pigeonpea yield per mm of total irrigation water plus rainfall declined 1.53 and 1.27 kg ha-1 in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Peanut performed best in irrigated as well as in rainfed environments, followed by cowpea, soybean, and mungbean. Pigeonpea was suitable only for the relatively dry, rainfed environment. Results indicate the need to match the suitable food legumes to maximize the rice land use. ### Countries mentioned: Philippines ### Plant products search: glycine max;soybeans;cowpeas;rice;peanuts;mungbean;grain legumes;mung beans ### Topics keywords: drought stress;sprinkler irrigation;soil fertility;land use;soil moisture;drip irrigation;use efficiency;water deficit ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1989,,Agronomy journal,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND90002196&site=ehost-live,,#37258,,"",Experimental
Review and quantitative assessment of ex situ household rainwater harvesting systems in Ethiopia,"","Abstract: E. x situ household rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have been introduced at a large scale in Ethiopia to increase the water availability for smallholders through supplementary irrigation. The first objective of this paper is to review the performance of these systems in Ethiopia based on various assessment studies. The second objective is to provide quantitative biophysical and socio-economic analyses of ex situ household RWH systems contributing to the better understanding of their performance and the identification of options to improve their performance. Uptake of RWH systems by smallholders in Ethiopia is limited and the available information suggests that this is associated among others with poor planning and implementation, poorly functioning input and output markets and the lack of farmers' skills to use these systems effectively. Our quantitative meta-analyses illustrate that water availability of three studied RWH systems is low in relation to crop water needs, particularly for maize. The variation in area that can be irrigated across years exposes users of RWH systems to considerable risks as the availability of irrigation water depends on prevailing rainfall conditions. The area that can be irrigated varies greatly depending on amount and distribution of rainfall, type of RWH system and crop type. The economics of onion (cash crop) are promising only for plastic lined RWH systems, but those for maize are unfavourable independent of the studied RWH systems. Associated labour requirements especially for water lifting and application are high and possibly constraining the sustainable use of RWH systems. The potential of ex situ household RWH systems to increase agricultural production and income is site-specific depending on biophysical, institutional and socio-economic conditions, and depends on household-specific conditions. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: onions;maize ### Topics keywords: site specific;cover crop;rural household;special issue;cash crop;large scale;sweet potato;farming system;among others;management practice;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2011,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2011.03.009,,#36570,,Meha Jain (2019-06-16 02:11:54)(Screen): repeat abstract; ,Meta-Analysis
"REFORMA: a new project for identification and selection of resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed crops for Mediterranean agricultural systems.","","Abstract: Crop-livestock and feed systems have huge importance for Mediterranean regions to satisfy the increasing demand for animal products, increase the economic stability of smallholders and produce typical animal products with high added-value, while contributing to sustainable farming, environment protection and efficient nutrient cycling. These systems are threatened, however, by the marked insufficiency of high-protein feedstuff, the overexploitation of forage resources, the increasing costs and/or the decreasing availability of irrigation water and mineral fertilizers, and the increasing drought and heat stress arising from climate change. The development of resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed legume crops could definitely alleviate these constraints. This is the objective of the ArimNet project ""Resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed crops for Mediterranean agricultural systems (REFORMA)"", which joins nine research institutions from Italy, France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and USA in an integrated manner to develop: (1) lucerne varieties with tolerance to severe drought, salinity, heat and grazing; (2) pea varieties with drought tolerance, targeted to grain and forage production; (3) cost-efficient marker-assisted selection procedures, and ecologically-based breeding strategies, for lucerne and pea; (4) lucerne-based and pea-based forage crops, taking into account the legume plant types, the associated grass or cereal species, the level of site drought stress, the acceptability by farmers, the forage quality and the target utilization. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco;Tunisia;Algeria;United States;France;Italy ### Plant products search: peas;lucerne;cereals;grain;feed legumes ### Programs found: arimnet project ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;animal welfare;natural resource;drought stress;soil fertility;CC;NPK;environmental impact;taking account;crop rotation;dairy cow;environmental protection;heat stress;protected area;organic fertilizer;animal husbandry;cover crop;climate change;sustainable development;mineral fertilizer;sewage sludge;drought tolerance;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2012,,"Options Mediterraneennes.

"Regional application of a cropping systems simulation model: crop residue retention in maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico.","","Abstract: To ensure the productivity of smallholder maize production systems in Central America, increased attention must be paid to conserving soil and water resources. Various stakeholders from national agricultural research services (NARS), networks, non-governmental organizations (NGO's) and research institutes seek to develop and target productivity enhancing resource conserving management practices such as crop residue retention systems. To support this process, a methodology with explicit spatial and temporal dimensions using the DSSAT crop simulation models was developed and applied to the case study of residue retention in maize production systems of Jalisco, Mexico. Systems where crop residues were partially or totally retained were compared with systems with no residue retention. Variables considered included crop production, soil surface runoff water, soil organic carbon and soil organic nitrogen content. Gridded climate surfaces and a range of soil profile scenarios formed the basis of the regional input. Three levels of nitrogen application (0, 150 and 235 kg ha-1) were selected to represent current agronomic practices. Simulation models for maize and fallow were run in sequence for 12 consecutive years. Results demonstrated that soil water holding capacity and topography affected benefits of residue retention much more than nitrogen management. Benefits to maize production from residue retention were found mainly in areas in the northeast of Jalisco and surrounding regions, where low precipitation limits maize production. Reductions in soil surface runoff due to residue retention were most evident in high rainfall areas in the central-east of Jalisco and surrounding regions. Although the effect of soil loss is not accounted for in DSSAT, areas of pronounced soil surface runoff reduction are hypothesized to be areas of productivity gain in the longer term. The assessment provided insight in the regional potential for and the soil and climate conditions under which successful introduction of residue retention in maize cropping systems in Jalisco may be achieved. In combination with socio-economic assessment studies and experimental work, the approach and its results contribute to targeted introduction of new production technologies. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico ### Plant products search: maize ### Measurements for interventions: nitrogen application;nitrogen ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;EC;cropping system;CA;soil fertility;rural community;NGO;surface runoff;contract farming;DOC;bulk density;longer term;residue retention;soil organic carbon;OC;management practice;short term;organic carbon;crop residue ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2004,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2003.12.005,,#37071,,"",Experimental
Seed yield of winter grain legumes on dryland sites in Chile.,"","Abstract: Lentil and garden pea are normally the only crops planted by small scale farmers during winter in the inland and coastal drylands of South-Central Chile with 700-1000 mm annual rainfall.

Small-scale farmer irrigation in South Africa: implications for extension.,"","Abstract: The study focuses on an overall evaluation of small-scale farmer irrigation schemes in South Africa in 1996, with particular reference to the implications for extension. Some 202 such schemes were identified, with 37 108 participants, of whom the majority (63%) were food plot holders. Except for some larger commercial schemes, participants were mainly women who are often disadvantaged in terms of access to resources. With the exception of sugarcane and limited areas of other crops, efficiency of production was disappointingly low, with many farmers carrying high debt loads. Many projects are in dire need of rehabilitation, including diagnostic analysis, amended water legislation, land reform, increased responsibility of participants, appropriate technology, farmer selection and integration in rural development, all factors in which agricultural extension has an important role to play. ### Countries mentioned: South Africa ### Plant products search: sugarcane ### Topics keywords: small scale;land reform;drought stress;water saving;SA;rural development;extension service;small scale farmer;irrigation scheme ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",1997,,South African Journal of Agricultural Extension,,,,,,,#36188,,"",Observational

"REFORMA: a new project for identification and selection of resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed crops for Mediterranean agricultural systems.","","Abstract: Crop-livestock and feed systems have huge importance for Mediterranean regions to satisfy the increasing demand for animal products, increase the economic stability of smallholders and produce typical animal products with high added-value, while contributing to sustainable farming, environment protection and efficient nutrient cycling. These systems are threatened, however, by the marked insufficiency of high-protein feedstuff, the overexploitation of forage resources, the increasing costs and/or the decreasing availability of irrigation water and mineral fertilizers, and the increasing drought and heat stress arising from climate change. The development of resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed legume crops could definitely alleviate these constraints. This is the objective of the ArimNet project ""Resilient, water- and energy-efficient forage and feed crops for Mediterranean agricultural systems (REFORMA)"", which joins nine research institutions from Italy, France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and USA in an integrated manner to develop: (1) lucerne varieties with tolerance to severe drought, salinity, heat and grazing; (2) pea varieties with drought tolerance, targeted to grain and forage production; (3) cost-efficient marker-assisted selection procedures, and ecologically-based breeding strategies, for lucerne and pea; (4) lucerne-based and pea-based forage crops, taking into account the legume plant types, the associated grass or cereal species, the level of site drought stress, the acceptability by farmers, the forage quality and the target utilization. ### Countries mentioned: Morocco;Tunisia;Algeria;United States;France;Italy ### Plant products search: peas;lucerne;cereals;grain;feed legumes ### Programs found: arimnet project ### Topics keywords: nitrogen fertilizer;animal welfare;natural resource;drought stress;soil fertility;CC;NPK;environmental impact;taking account;crop rotation;dairy cow;environmental protection;heat stress;protected area;organic fertilizer;animal husbandry;cover crop;climate change;sustainable development;mineral fertilizer;sewage sludge;drought tolerance;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Middle East and North Africa;Europe and Central Asia;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2012,,"Options Mediterraneennes.

Review and quantitative assessment of ex situ household rainwater harvesting systems in Ethiopia [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: Ex situ household rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems have been introduced at a large scale in Ethiopia to increase the water availability for smallholders through supplementary irrigation. The first objective of this paper is to review the performance of these systems in Ethiopia based on various assessment studies. The second objective is to provide quantitative biophysical and socio-economic analyses of ex situ household RWH systems contributing to the better understanding of their performance and the identification of options to improve their performance. Uptake of RWH systems by smallholders in Ethiopia is limited and the available information suggests that this is associated among others with poor planning and implementation, poorly functioning input and output markets and the lack of farmers’ skills to use these systems effectively. Our quantitative meta-analyses illustrate that water availability of three studied RWH systems is low in relation to crop water needs, particularly for maize. The variation in area that can be irrigated across years exposes users of RWH systems to considerable risks as the availability of irrigation water depends on prevailing rainfall conditions. The area that can be irrigated varies greatly depending on amount and distribution of rainfall, type of RWH system and crop type. The economics of onion (cash crop) are promising only for plastic lined RWH systems, but those for maize are unfavourable independent of the studied RWH systems. Associated labour requirements especially for water lifting and application are high and possibly constraining the sustainable use of RWH systems. The potential of ex situ household RWH systems to increase agricultural production and income is site-specific depending on biophysical, institutional and socio-economic conditions, and depends on household-specific conditions. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Plant products search: onions;maize;wheat ### Topics keywords: site specific;cover crop;rural household;special issue;cash crop;large scale;sweet potato;farming system;among others;management practice;precision agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2011,,Agricultural water management,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND44585889&site=ehost-live,,#36421,,"",Meta-Analysis
"Resource use efficiency and farm productivity gaps of smallholder dairy farming in North-west Michoacan, Mexico.","","Abstract: Smallholder dairy farms that intensify production risk resource degradation and increased dependence on external feeds and fertilizers due to lack of knowledge and appropriate technology, which undermines farm productivity and profitability. Here we analyze underlying causes at farm level of such process through an integrated analysis at the farm scale by assessing current resource use efficiency for grazing-based dairy farming systems representative of NW Michoacan, Mexico. Whole-farm yield gaps were quantified by comparing current farms to virtual reference farms that have the same farm surface area but improved farm management. Productivity of reference farms was calculated by assuming best crop production practices (as observed within the set of case study farms) and improved herd management. Three family-based (FB) and three semi-specialized (SS) dairy systems spanning three levels of intensification in terms of density of livestock units (LU): extensive (E, 1.2 LU ha-1) were monitored during one year (rainy and dry seasons) to assess productivity and resource use efficiencies. Milk production was generally low and variable (2.2-4.3 Mg milk cow-1 lactation-1, and 0.6-5.8 Mg ha-1) due to high incidence of mastitis, a large fraction of non-productive animals in the herd and inefficient reproduction management. During the dry season, grazing areas provided insufficient metabolizable energy, and milk production was sustained through increased use of concentrates (from 310 g kg-1 DMI in rainy season to 454 g kg-1 DMI-1 in dry season of the herd) and conserved forage. All farms had positive nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium balances, averaging 7516, 156, and 196 kg ha-1, respectively. Nutrients in animal excreta were mostly not recycled on the farms but lost to the environment, and nutrient surpluses increased with livestock density. The reference farms exhibited an attainable milk yield of 2.7 Mg ha-1 on the basis of full feed self-supply, and 4.2 Mg ha-1 when the crude protein limitation in the ration was lifted. Compared to the reference farm actual milk yields were on average 78.4% lower on FB farms and 57.9% lower on SS farms. The underlying causes of the farm yield gap differed between farms and were due to sub-optimal areas of forage maize, low forage and forage maize productivity and deficient herd management. We conclude that the farm yield gap analysis was effective in identifying the major shortcomings in management of the dairy farming systems and enabled formulation of change avenues for farm reconfiguration focusing on combined improvements in crop, feed and herd management and recycling of nutrients through manure management. ### Countries mentioned: Mexico ### Plant products search: maize ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: milk yield;potassium;nitrogen;phosphorus ### Topics keywords: use efficiency;dry matter;sweet potato;NPK;dry season;agroforestry system;smallholder dairy;farming system;small scale;value chain;NP;dairy cow;DM;SS;yield gap;dairy cattle;management practice;CP;food insecurity;spatial distribution;crude protein;dairy farm;crop residue;sewage sludge;dairy farming;human activity ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055);IBRD",2014,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2013.11.001,,#37297,,"",Observational
Seasonal water use and water productivity of millet-based cropping systems in the Nigerian Sudan savanna near Kano.,"","Abstract: Quantification of resource use in dominant millet-cowpea (M-C) and millet-sorghum-cowpea (M-S-C) intercropping systems in peasant agriculture was carried out using farmers' practices, under the low rainfall and poor nutrient supply situations of the semi-arid zone of Nigeria. On-station trials were conducted at Minjibir near Kano during the 1994 and 1995 rainy seasons to determine the components of the water balance and compare water use (WU) and water productivity of millet planted sole (SM) at the recommended optimum densities and intercropped at farmers' planting densities under two levels of soil fertility. Infiltration rates were generally high, with an overall mean in the porous sandy soil of 17 cm h-1. Deep drainage losses accounted for 15% of annual rainfall in a low rainfall season (1995) and an estimated more than 20% in the wet 1994 season. Additional top dress NPK fertilizers (OM+IF) to cereals prior to the commencement of reproductive stages, increased soil water extraction in the intercrops in the drier year, for which soil water status was, therefore, higher in plots where only organic manure (OM) was applied. The relatively higher annual rainfall in 1994 generally increased soil water use. Later maturity of sorghum in the M-S-C intercrop increased WU of this cropping system, particularly in 1995. SM produced significantly (P<0.01 in 1994 and P<0.05 in 1995) higher total dry matter (TDM) than the intercrops, a trend shown over the complete growing season most of the time, with the exception of OM SM in 1995. The total grain yield was significantly (P<0.01) higher in SM in the wet 1994 season. Millet, particularly when intercropped, used water more efficiently for grain production in 1995 along with other limiting resources. It showed better adaptation to moisture stress by producing similar (P=0.79) harvest indices (HIs) in sole and intercropped millet. HIs of the sole cereals and the OM M-C were relatively higher in the 1995 than in the wet 1994 season. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria;Sudan ### Plant products search: millets;sorghum grain;cowpeas;grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Topics keywords: organic farming;cropping system;soil fertility;SM;dry matter;NPK;net return;winter wheat;chemical fertilizer;organic manure;NP;DM;planting density;harvest index;economic benefit;medicinal plant;organic matter;plant height;intercropping system;OM;growing season;soil moisture;summer maize;FYM;secondary metabolite;grain yield;NPK fertilizer ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IDA",2002,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-3774(02)00008-2,,#36203,,"",Experimental
Smallholder drip irrigation technology: potentials and constraints in the highlands of Eritrea.,"","Abstract: Irrigation in general, and pressurized irrigation in particular, are at an early stage of development in Eritrea. Currently, there are only approximately 28 000 ha under surface irrigation systems. There is no proper assessment of the extent of pressurized irrigation systems, but it has been estimated at less than 1000 ha. Smallholder irrigation technologies developed by International Development Enterprises (IDE) and consisting of bucket, drum, and micro-sprinkler kits were introduced in several villages in the highlands at the beginning of 2001 by the Center for Development and Environment (CDE). Joint research has been conducted by CDE and the Asmara College of Agriculture and Aquatic Science since March 2001 to assess the social, economic, and technical preconditions for successful implementation of the technology. As used here, the term ""smallholder"" refers to farmers who manage farms smaller than 1 ha entirely on their own, with little or no input from external government resources. ### Countries mentioned: Eritrea ### Measurements for interventions: irrigation system ### Topics keywords: drip irrigation system;plant height;drip irrigation;DAS ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2003,,Mountain Research and Development,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2003)023[0027:SDIT]2.0.CO;2,,#36339,,"",Unclear

Main findings: (1) small farmers prefer smaller wells than recommended size; (2) well irrigation has determined marked changes in cropping pattern and crop productivity; commercial profitability analysis shows that the benefit cost ratios of dug wells scheme are 8%, 10%, 12%, and 1.53, 1.47, and 1.42 rates respectively; the internal rate of return of the scheme is 34.41%; social benefit cost ratios are much higher than the BC ratios found in the commercial profitability analysis; the intra- and inter-regional income redistribution effects of the scheme are found to be substantial. ### Programs found: irrigation program ### Topics keywords: cropping pattern;ecosystem service;cropping system;net return;water saving;specie richness;BC;protected area;cost ratio;agroforestry system;economic benefit;biodiversity conservation;human activity;beef cattle",1982,,Artha Vijnana,,,,,,,#36505,,"",Observational
Soil and water conservation practices in the savanna of northern Nigeria(a review).,"","Abstract: The intensification of agriculture in the savanna of northern Nigeria as a result of population pressure, negative effects of climatic change on the environment, infrastructural development and other forms of land use in the last one decade, have led to serious ecological disasters affecting the lives and income of a large majority of the rural people whose basic means of livelihood is farming. The challenge posed by the loss of several hectarage of farmlands on account of natural or human-induced ecological problems in terms of food security and sustenance of natural agro-ecosystems is enormous, especially for the resource low-income farmers. Adoption of soil and water conservation measures by farmers is low since these measures tend to be labour intensive, costly and have a more long term effect. The need to conserve soil resources for greater productivity and protect the environment from degradation is of utmost priority. This paper reviews some of the existing soil and water conservation practices in the savanna of northern Nigeria with a view to assessing their potentials for crop production and effect an overall on the environment. ### Countries mentioned: Nigeria ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;factor affecting;agro ecosystem;point view;BMP;pest control;negative effect;long term;human health;conservation practice;climatic change;management practice;food security;short term;cover crop;climate change;land use;factor influencing;human activity;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2012,,"Journal of Agriculture, Forestry and Social Sciences",,,,,,,#36980,,"",Systematic Review; Unclear
Smallholder farmer innovation. 1. Replacing transplanted rice monoculture with direct seeded rice based cropping systems.,"","Abstract: We describe our experience working with smallholder farmers on the East India Plateau to develop more diverse and intensive farming systems. What at first appears as a relatively small change in rice establishment agronomy, turns out to be a key to unlocking a range of development opportunities including increasing crop productivity, farm profitability, and climate resilience, enhanced human nutrition, and empowerment of women. The approach is illustrated with a local farmer innovation in rice establishment systems. Transplanted rice is very risky in this environment due to lack of irrigation, erratic rainfall, soil type and undulating landscape. Farmers have developed a direct seeded rice system that is different, perhaps unique, from previous direct seeded systems. Here the soil remains unpuddled, seed and fertiliser are manually sown in lines, and weed control is achieved with small manually operated implements. In addition to improved yield stability, early sowing and early harvesting, and using residual soil water for a second crop, the new system releases women from labour drudgery (no transplanting or hand weeding), is more climate resilient (avoids rice crop failure due to lack of ponding needed for transplanting), and is nutrition sensitive (harvesting the rice crop earlier in the 'hunger window', and enabling a second oilseed, pulse or vegetable crop). The new system is popular with farmers and adoption is expanding rapidly. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: oilseeds;rice;grain legumes;vegetables ### Topics keywords: cropping system;weed control;hand weeding;smallholder farmer;farming system;DAS ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2015,,"Building Productive, Diverse and Sustainable Landscapes, 17th Australian Agronomy Conference, 20-24 September 2015, Hobart, Australia.

Strategies to improve the irrigation efficiency of raised beds on small farms.,"","Abstract: The suboptimal irrigation management on small raised beds farms in the Indus Basin is considered to reduce irrigation efficiency and exacerbates waterlogging and salinity. Addressing this issue, farmer managed irrigations on commonly used Narrow Bed (NB) with furrow spacings 66 cm and newly introduced Wide Bed (WB) with furrow spacing 130 cm on sandy clay loam, were investigated using the irrigation modelling software, WinSRFR, to explore irrigation management strategies for improving irrigation eficiency. The study revealed existing average application efficiency of low quarter 71%, 87%, distribution uniformity of low quarter 70%, 80% and adequacy of low quarter 100%, 90% for NB and WB, respectively. Majority (67%) of WB irrigations monitored were under irrigated while large number (50%) of NB irrigation were over irrigated. Simulation modelling showed that achievement of above 90% Potential Application Efficiency (PAE) is possible by improving operation (inflow rate and time to irrigation cut-off) and field design (field length and width/number of furrows per set). This work raised the prospects of improved irrigation efficiency of raised beds in Indus Basin, which may be possible without incurring any costs associated with altered infrastructure, new or modified machinery, or increased labour. ### Countries mentioned: Canada;Gambia ### Topics keywords: soil fertility;nutrient balance;net return;flow rate ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa;North America ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2017,,Sarhad Journal of Agriculture,,,,,,,#36671,,"",Modeling
Studies on the mixed farming systems under irrigated conditions in semi-arid tract of Haryana.,"","Abstract: An integrated study was conducted at Haryana Agricultural University Farm, India, to compare the economics of keeping buffaloes vs. crossbred cows under mixed farming conditions. Three cows or 3 buffaloes were kept on 1-ha units, 80% of which was used for fodder crops, and 20% for feed and grain crops, and records were maintained from July 1984 to June 1987. For units with cows and buffaloes resp., the mean annual expenditure was Rs 26 692 and Rs 27 800, income from sale of milk was Rs 34 897 and Rs 24 578, net income was Rs 18 433 and Rs 9315, and annual income/Rs 100 invested was Rs 69.05 and Rs 33.50. The cows and buffaloes resp. showed mean annual milk yield of 4378 and 2009 litres, dry period of 43 and 88 days, calving interval of 408 and 420 days, and lactation period of 368 and 303 days. Results indicated that, where irrigation is available so that green fodder can be provided throughout the year, farming with crossbred cows will help to reduce the costs of milk production on small farms in semi-arid areas. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: grain ### Animal products search: milk ### Measurements for crops: milk ### Measurements for interventions: milk yield ### Topics keywords: net income;calving interval;mixed farming;economic benefit;annual income;CI;dairy farming;farming system ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1990,,Indian Journal of Dairy Science,,,,,,,#37106,,"",Experimental; Observational
Summary of five years of IAEA funded project on improvement of family poultry production in Africa: results and discussions.,"","Abstract: During the period of February 1999 and April 2004, a study was undertaken to elucidate the major disease conditions and factors limiting family chicken production in Tanzania. It covered six villages in two zones involving 43 households from which socio-economic data was gathered by use of a structured questionnaire in the wet and dry seasons. During field visits, the birds were clinically examined, various samples collected, sick and dead ones autopsied. There was significant variation in the flock size and structure in the interviewed households. The households kept a total of 1099 and 1352 chickens with an average of 25.5 and 31.4 per household in the wet and dry seasons respectively. The ratio of chick/growers/adults was 10:10:14 and 11:10:10 in wet and dry seasons respectively. The cocks/hen ratio was 1:3.5. Whereas the average number of clutches per year was 3, the number of eggs per clutch was 12 and therefore the number of eggs was 36 per hen/year. Average hatchability for the two seasons was recorded as 84%. Chick mortality was found to be 30% and resulted mainly from diseases and predation. Only few households did not provide housing at all while majority provided shelters of varying quality. In all the households, scavenging was the system of feeding and sometimes supplemented by household food scraps and local feeds. Several diseases and in particular Newcastle disease (ND) was shown to be the major constraint inhibiting rural chicken development. Women played a major role in family poultry production through provision of labour but men made several decisions on the use of the resources. Blood smears were prepared for protozoological examination: 349 (wet season), 278 (dry season). Only 11 of the 349 (3.1%) birds in the wet season were infected with and (prevalence 2.8% and 0.3%, respectively). No parasites were seen in the samples collected during the dry season. Fresh faecal samples (209) in the wet season and dry season were collected and examined for egg worm count using the McMaster technique. The cross sectional prevalence study showed that about 77% of faecal samples examined had positive results for helminths. Eight different species of helminths eggs were identified. During the dry season, serum samples were collected from a total of 362 ND unvaccinated birds and analysed by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for ND virus antibodies. The results indicated that only 56 (15.5%) birds had positive HI titres at a serum dilution of 1:8 and above while 306 (85.5%) birds were negative. A serologically monitored ND vaccination exercise using thermostable vaccine strain I-2 was undertaken. The results of HI and ELISA tests indicated that vaccinations had been very effective. Population dynamics of the flocks were determined on a monthly basis along with the cost of the interventions. This was used as a basic database for the partial budget determination.

"Study on milk off take from Issa type Dromedaries under pastoral environmental conditions in and around DireDawa, Ethiopia.","","Abstract: A study on milk off take was conducted on 113 lactating Issa type camels in and around DireDawa Administrative Council between October 2000 and May 2001. 33 of the camels were browsing on irrigated land while the remaining 80 camels on non-irrigated land. All camels were hand milked after the calves had suckled the udder. The volume of milk harvested was determined for different parities (1st, 2nd and subsequent parities), months of lactation, milking frequencies (once per day, twice per day and three times per day) and watering intervals (once per day, once in two days and once in three or more days). The average daily milk off take of browsing camels on irrigated and non-irrigated lands were 5.39 and 3.24 litres, respectively. The daily milk yield of camels on irrigated and non-irrigated lands which were milked once, twice and thrice a day were 3.0 and 1.5, 5.17 and 3.18, and 6.88 and 4.13 litres, respectively. Non-irrigated land camels allowed to drink once per day, once in two days and once in three or more days produced an average daily milk yield of 3.44, 3.52 and 2.14 litres, respectively. The differences in daily milk off take recorded for the different milking frequencies, watering intervals and between browsing lands were statistically significant. The total lactation milk off take estimated for 12 months of lactation duration were 2043 and 1063 litres, respectively, for irrigated and non-irrigated land browser camels.

Conservation agriculture (CA), based on the principles of minimal soil disturbance, year-round ground cover, and diverse crop rotations, is being promoted to sustainably improve crop production, food security, and smallholder farm income. Adoption of CA principles in the region has predominately been limited to eliminating tillage and retaining residues, with little adoption of crop rotations. In this study, three cropping systems—continuous no-till maize, CA rotation, and conventional tillage rotation—were established on smallholder farms in the Nkhotakota and Dowa districts, two distinct agro-ecological zones in Malawi. Three-year crop rotations of cassava, cowpea, and maize and cassava, soybean, maize were implemented in CA and conventional tillage, respectively, in Nkhotakota. In Dowa, a 3-year rotation of sweet potato, bean, and maize was implemented in both CA and conventional tillage. Cropping systems were analyzed for their impacts on crop production, soil-water relations, soil quality, and financial returns from 2011 to 2014. No-till maize and CA improved infiltration and the soil water balance compared to conventional tillage in Nkhotakota but did not affect soil-water relations in Dowa. No-till maize and CA increased exchangeable K, Ca, and Mg and reduced soil erosion compared to conventional tillage. In no-till maize, retention of low quality residue resulted in N immobilization. Conservation agriculture improved plant available N and nutrient cycling compared to no-till maize, but less residue cover increased bulk density compared to no-till maize and conventional tillage. Soils in conventional tillage had the most plant available N, which could lead to N leaching and reduced fertilizer-use efficiency. Tillage and residue management did not affect yields of cassava, sweet potato, cowpea, soybean, or bean. Crop rotation, regardless of tillage practice, increased maize yields compared to no-till maize. Net revenue was highest in no-till maize and labor productivity and gross margins were higher in no-till and conventional tillage than in CA rotation. Before widespread adoption of CA can occur, further research is needed to improve alternative crop production under CA management and identify the most appropriate agroecological zones for successful CA. ### Countries mentioned: Malawi ### Plant products search: soybeans;maize;cassava;cowpeas;sweet potatoes;potatoes;grain legumes ### Topics keywords: soil erosion;cropping system;CA;use efficiency;sweet potato;gross margin;tillage practice;bulk density;conventional tillage;adoption CA;taking account;NH4;NO3;farming system;beef cattle;GM;NT;small scale;crop rotation;NP;cluster analysis;non GM;farm size;family farming;food security;genetic diversity;sustainable intensification;spatial distribution;trace element;smallholder farmer;CT;SP ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2015,,,,,,,http://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1711732300?accountid=9783,,#36652,,"",Observational
Sustainable use of poor quality water with proper scheduling of irrigation and nitrogen levels for a rice crop,"","Abstract: Over-exploitation of groundwaters to meet the water requirements for rice-wheat systems is causing both a fall in groundwater levels and their quality deterioration in semi-arid parts of India. Adoption of rice-wheat cropping systems by the farmers using poor quality (sodic) waters for irrigation may adversely affect soil health and thereby reduce crop yield. Adoption of an irrigation schedule coupled with optimum nitrogen doses can be advantageous for sustaining yields of rice in these areas. Strategies for optimum use of these inputs has to be based on the knowledge of soil-water-nutrient-plant interactions evolved through field studies. In order to develop such relations, studies involving several combinations of irrigation levels and nitrogen doses were conducted on rice crops at Kaithal (India), and their effect on biomass, yield, water and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were studied during 1993 and 1994. Irrigation schedules were based on the period of submergence ranging from 0 to 6 days. The nitrogen doses varied from 0 to 180 kg ha-1. Both irrigation and nitrogen had a positive effect on yield, which increased from 1729 kg ha-1 (continuous submergence without fertilizer) to 4522 kg ha-1 (irrigation at 3 days disappearance of water with 180 kg N ha-1. At 60 kg N ha-1, NUE varied from 35.4 to 40.9 kg ha-1 grain per kg of N. Further increase in the dose of N upto 180 kg ha-1 however resulted in a decline in NUE. Nitrogen and irrigation had a positive influence on applied water efficiency (AWE). Under continuous submerged conditions, the beneficial effect of N on AWE was observed only up to 120 kg ha-1. But at lower levels of irrigation (3 and 6 days disappearance of water), these effects continued even up to 180 kg ha-1.

Technological intervention in sustaining mango productivity in a resource poor farmers' field of Uttar Pradesh.,"","Abstract: Mango productivity and production is low in Uttar Pradesh as compared to national average. It is further low in case of a resource poor farmer to support its orchard productivity. Proper dissemination of production and protection technologies and lack of timely intervention of these technologies makes it worse. The present work was undertaken under the financial assistance by National Horticulture Board and technological demonstration by ICAR-CISH at village Kitnakhera, Lucknow district. Age of orchards and suboptimal management of canopy, nutrient, water, diseases and insect pests are the major factors constraining the productivity and quality of mango. Interventions of ICAR-CISH technologies resulted it successful mango production with good remuneration to farmers. Results revealed that soils of the mango orchards had low water holding capacity (17.1-20.9%) and suffering from deficiency of zinc, copper and boron. Centre opening resulted in increased light penetration from 6100 to 6800 mol m yr to 10000-10500 mol m yr. The fruit borer incidence was reduced from 70-80 to 1-2 per cent. Average fruit yield increased from 47.05 kg/tree in the previous years to 82.05 kg/tree due to the adoption of technological interventions. Percentage of 'A' and 'B' grade fruits increased from &lt;5 and 20% to 17.3 and 54.0% respectively. Net incomes of farmers were also increased. Farmers were highly enthusiastic and satisfied with the involvement in different activities with their increased net income. ### Plant products search: mangoes ### Measurements for interventions: orchard ### Topics keywords: net income;insect pest;economic benefit;net return",2016,,GERF Bulletin of Biosciences,,,,,,,#36696,,"Ellen McCullough (2019-06-13 05:49:50)(Screen): Unclear if this is an experiment.

"The intensive rice growth system reduces seed amount for sowing, increases plant yields and saves irrigation water.","","Abstract: The work was developed at Los Palacios Rice Research Station for three years and later at small-scale producers' areas belonging to a non-specialized system (popular rice) as an agricultural extension. The study consisted of determining the effect of seedling age, plant spacing and seedling number per site on agricultural yield. Results showed a seed amount reduction in the nursery, to the value of 5 kg.ha.year, which represent between 35 and 40% of that used in the traditional transplanting system. In addition, agricultural yields increased up to 2.0 t.ha; there was a greater tillering and root system development per plant compared to the check control. On the other hand, when crop irrigation was discontinued for 21 days, 3 300 m.ha.year of water were saved. ### Countries mentioned: Cuba ### Plant products search: rice ### Topics keywords: small scale;supply chain;small scale producer;contract farming ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: Upper-middle-income countries ($3,896 to $12,055)",2010,,Cultivos Tropicales,,,,,,,#36338,,"",Experimental
Tillage and vegetative barrier effects on soil conservation and short-term economic benefits in the central Kenya highlands.,"","Abstract: Minimum tillage and vegetative barriers can conserve soil and water resources in the steep-sloping highlands of East Africa but there has been little adoption by smallholder farmers. Soil conservation efficiency and short-term economic benefits provided by tillage and vegetative barriers were assessed over four cropping seasons to understand performance under local farming conditions. Minimum tillage was compared with regular tillage and vegetative barriers (leucaena and Napier) with no barriers. Maize and soybean yields were greater with than without vegetative barriers, except with Napier barriers when minimum tillage was practiced where strong root competition occured. Cumulatively for the four cropping seasons, Napier barriers with regular tillage conserved most soil (72%) followed by Napier with minimum tillage (53%). The least soil (1%) was conserved for minimum tillage without barriers and leucaena barriers were intermediate in decreasing soil erosion. The highest positive marginal rate of returns (MRRs) were realized under leucaena barriers with regular tillage (2.09) followed by Napier with regular tillage (1.32). Minimum tillage without barriers had the lowest positive MRRs (0.08). Future increase in the price of key inputs would have greater depressive effect on the MRRs of Napier barriers with regular tillage than leucaena barriers with regular tillage. Minimum tillage without barriers was inefficient in soil conservation particularly when rainfall was intense and had poor MRRs. Leucaena barriers conserved less soil than Napier barriers but were more economically attractive, demonstrating a clear trade-off between soil erosion that is likely to impact crop yields in the long-term and short-term economic benefits. Napier barriers with regular tillage present a win-win scenario due to efficient soil conservation and attractive economic returns provided future prices of labour and Napier cuttings remain stable. ### Countries mentioned: Kenya;New Zealand ### Plant products search: soybeans;maize;leucaena ### Measurements for interventions: minimum tillage;tillage ### Topics keywords: short term;soil erosion;minimum tillage;tillage practice;crop rotation;CA;MT;NT;economic benefit;smallholder farmer;long term ### Geo regions: East Asia and Pacific;Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2011,,Field Crops Research,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.03.002,,#36284,,"",Experimental
"The role of forages in sustainable intensification of crop-livestock agro-ecosystems in the face of climate change: The case for landscapes in babati, Northern Tanzania","","Abstract: Agro-ecosystem productivity is highly dependent on soil moisture fluxes yet climate change induces unpredictable dynamic interactions on water and nutrient resources. This study assessed on-farm seasonal productivity, runoff and soil moisture storage estimates within forage grass and forage legume intercrops at the Long site in Babati District of Northern Tanzania and how these would be impacted by climate change. The WaterWorld model was used to ascertain the impact of climate change on temperature and moisture fluxes at landscape level within these agro-ecosystems. Study results revealed a steady increase in temperature and a projected increase in rainfall over the next 40 years to the 2050s with an average future precipitation of 1300 mm yr-1 compared to the current baseline of 960 mm yr-1. On-farm seasonal water balance estimates within forage grass-forage legume intercrops revealed that with the 645 mm of rainfall received in the 2014 rainy season, evapotranspiration (ET) was the predominant factor accounting for about 75 % of the fluxes. We demonstrate that compared to the control trials, runoff levels were significantly lower in areas with forage grass-legume intercrops which translated to 20 % lower runoff levels; there was higher soil moisture storage with an average of about 25 mm (30 % higher) in areas with forage grass-forage legume intercrops than the bare plot control areas. The Napier-Desmodium and Napier-Lablab combinations had about 15 % higher soil moisture storage and 30 % higher water productivity compared to the sole Napier accessions. The sole forage grasses depicted about 15-50 % higher runoff levels compared to the Napier- Desmodium and Napier-Lablab combinations. In doing so, a combination of perennial forages (grasses and legumes) improves the sustainability of farming systems through erosion control and soil moisture retention beyond serving as feed resources. Using both qualitative and quantitative metrics from this study, we draw on the sustainable intensification indicators framework to illustrate explicit linkages on synergies and tradeoffs associated with forage interventions within smallholder farming systems. Sustainable intensification within these landscapes will thus require more innovative solutions that incorporate establishing different types of alternative forage grass-forage legume combinations coupled with other improved agronomic practices into a compendium package of interventions that allows for sustainable land use to cope with climate change and variability. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Plant products search: legumes ### Measurements for interventions: water productivity;forage ### Topics keywords: CA;soil fertility;SM;CC;agro ecosystem;point view;smallholder farming;MT;pest control;farming system;NT;long term;management practice;food security;cover crop;climate change;sustainable intensification;land use;soil moisture;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2016,,Climate Change and Multi-Dimensional Sustainability in African Agriculture: Climate Change and Sustainability in Agriculture,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41238-2_22,,#36742,,"",Experimental
Transgenic peanut overexpressing the DREB1A transcription factor has higher yields under drought stress,"","Abstract: Transgenic research using the DREB group of transcription factors has received much attention in developing drought-tolerant and climate-ready varieties of crop plants. While many reports have demonstrated increased tolerance to water deficits under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, only a few have tested possible effects under field conditions, with limited success in most cases. Here, we present evidence of a transgenic solution for enhanced drought tolerance in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), which is an important grain legume and a valuable cash crop for smallholder and resource-poor farmers occupying the largest portion of the farming systems in low income food deficit countries. The presence, integration, expression and inheritance of the transgene in advancing generations of the transgenic peanut plants were assessed using PCR, Southern blot, inverse-PCR, RT-PCR and q-PCR techniques. Four trials were conducted in various water stress regimes under varying vapour pressure deficits (VPDs), and drought tolerance was studied using various component traits of drought. A substantial yield improvement of up to 24 % in drought trials under field conditions was achieved across a wide range of stress intensities and was related to higher harvest indices (HIs). All transgenic events had significantly higher seed filling under drought and displayed 20-30 % lower pod yield reduction than their untransformed counterpart under drought stress. Two transgenic events showed yield advantage under drought stress that consistently had higher pod and seed yield than the untransformed parent under drought stress across all trials, without displaying any yield penalty under irrigated conditions. ### Plant products search: grain;grain legumes;peanuts ### Measurements for interventions: yield reduction;pod ### Topics keywords: drought stress;cropping system;use efficiency;water deficit;sweet potato;rural household;RT;pest control;farming system;NT;wide range;reduced tillage;crop rotation;human health;rural tourism;harvest index;cover crop;plant height;soil moisture;cash crop;crop residue;grain legume;drought tolerance;grain yield",2014,,Molecular Breeding,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11032-013-9952-7,,#37156,,"",""
UNDERUTILIZATION OF PUMP IRRIGATION FACILITIES IN THE NORTH-EAST OF THAILAND: A CASE STUDY OF ROI-ET,"","Abstract: This is a study of underutilization of pump irrigation facilities in the North-East of Thailand. Its main objectives are to describe the planning and the implementation of irrigation for agricultural development, to delineate economic and non-economic factors in relation to the utilization of irrigation for dry-season cropping, and to explain variations in the incidence of utilization of irrigated land in the dry-season. In the research, four methods for obtaining information were employed: survey of existing literature and government documents; questionnaires; in-depth interviews; and personal observation. Two pump irrigation projects in Roi-Et province were selected for an intensive study between September 1983 and April 1984. From the investigation of the utilization of irrigated land in the dry season at the regional level, it was found that, since the pump irrigation projects came into operation, the rate of utilization at the regional level has never exceeded one-fifth of the total irrigated area. Also, the examination in the trends of irrigation utilization in the North-East of Thailand has suggested that, in addition to the problem of water distribution, an investigation of farmers' decision-making processes is needed, both in subsistence activities and in the dimension of profit-maximization. The examination of water distribution in the two study areas had demonstrated that the inadequacy of water supply is not a direct result of distance from plot to the water source, and is not the only factor in explaining the underutilization of irrigated land for farming in the dry season. It has been revealed that the decisions of farmers to utilize their irrigated land for dry-season cropping are made from the evaluation of their food requirements and to earn or supplement their cash incomes. Irrigation has greatly aided the households which cannot produce enough wet-paddy for household consumption from the preceding wet-season. In addition, the decisions of dry-season croppers are made from an evaluation of their needs for the immediate future rather than for long-term planning. The amount of irrigated land utilized largely depends upon the household consumption needs and non-farm opportunities.

"Increasing crop yield in water scarce environments using locally available materials: an experience from semi-arid areas in Mpwapwa District, central Tanzania.","","Abstract: This paper presents experience on working with farmers in water scarce environments in improving crop yield through the application of locally available materials in semi-arid areas of Mpwapwa District, central Tanzania. Findings are presented from the interdisciplinary study that involved documenting farmers perceptions and on-farm field experimentation. In the farmers' perceptions study, three different traditional tillage practices applied by smallholder farmers in the area were identified. These are traditional no-till (TNT), shallow tillage (ST) and ridging tillage (RT). The impacts of various tillage practices on soil fertility improvement, reduced weed infestation, soil moisture retention and crop yield were the main factors considered by farmers when selecting a particular tillage practice to apply. In two cropping seasons (i.e. 2006/7 and 2007/8) on-farm field experimentations were carried to test the effects of the three traditional tillage practices, manure and mulching practices on soil moisture retention and crop yield. Results from this experiment showed traditional no-till fields to have the lowest soil moisture retention capacity and the lowest infiltration flow rate as well as lowest crop yield compared to other studied practices. It was observed that improving the current tillage practices by the application of manure to both ST and RT, and mulching to ST at rates affordable to smallholder farmers as identified during perception study (i.e. 5 tons/ha for manure and 3 tons/ha for mulching materials) results in increased crop yield. When the grain yield is compared between traditional no-till and shallow tillage with manure and mulching practices, the yield increase is between 50 and 100%. It was concluded that crop yield in water scarce environments such as the semi-arid areas of Mpwapwa District can be increased by applying locally available materials such as cow manure and mulching at rates affordable to smallholder farmers. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Plant products search: grain ### Measurements for crops: grain ### Measurements for interventions: manure ### Topics keywords: drought stress;land degradation;soil fertility;salt tolerance;SM;tillage practice;weed infestation;RT;flow rate;NT;reduced tillage;crop rotation;rural tourism;farmer perception;management practice;cover crop;soil moisture;weed control;extension service;crop residue;smallholder farmer;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2009,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.01.007,,#36845,,"",""
Triggering rural development through financing animal husbandry projects: experiences in India.,"","Abstract: Successful dairy farming depends on the quality of the main resources, i.e., the farmer, land, livestock and water. In developing countries these resources are generally deficient. This paper illustrates how these deficiencies can be overcome with the experience of a small farmer's family in India. This experience is then related to that in the development of India's dairy industry. The co-existence of abundant livestock wealth with vast rural poverty; the policy dilemma of choosing between cross-breds and native stock; the syphoning of urban purchasing power through the selling of milk; other productive livestock avenues for the poor and the provision of credit to livestock farmers are described. It is concluded that livestock rearing in India has been an effective instrument for increasing the productivity and incomes of the rural poor and thus an appropriate strategy for social change, and that the key to success lies in forging a sustained and effective link between product markets and the rural producers with the availability of finance from organized sources and on easy terms. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Animal products search: milk ### Programs found: animal husbandry (AH) project ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;developing country;rural household;dairy industry;rural poverty;rural development;dairy farming ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1985,,Economic Bulletin for Asia and the Pacific,,,,,,,#37398,,"",""
Transhumance livestock production in the Northern Areas of Pakistan: Nutritional inputs and productive outputs,"","Abstract: The Northern Areas of Pakistan form a mountainous, semi-arid region in which subsistence mixed farming is the predominant economic activity for the majority of the population, which numbers around 1 million. Following a period of relative isolation, construction of the Karakoram Highway and the ensuing development activity have been catalysts for rapid infrastructural and social change over the last two decades. In the study reported here, feed resources for the livestock enterprise, which is largely made up of cattle, goats and sheep, were studied in detail over the course of a single winter feeding season. Productive outputs including liveweight change, milk production and reproductive performance were also quantified over a full year. The aim of the study was to provide a quantitative description of the system and to assess the extent to which proximity to a major highway influenced livestock husbandary. Six villages across the region were selected for study as part of a 2 × 3 factorial design with one village per cell of the study design. Factors consisted of two geographical transects and three agro-ecological zones. Transects were the Karakoram Highway (KKH) transect which enjoyed relatively good transport infrastructure and the Gilgit Ghizer Region (GGR) transect where infrastructure was more limited. Agro-ecological zones were the single, transitional and double cropping zones. One village per transect from each of the three main agro-ecological zones was chosen for study with 6-7 households within each village studied. Results showed that feed resources per household did not vary significantly according to transect or zone but cattle numbers per household were higher in the GGR transect than in the KKH transect indicating a heavier reliance on subsistence livestock production in this transect. Live weight and body condition of livestock in the Northern Areas changed markedly over the annual cycle. Losses of live weight were in the order of 10% over winter while summer gains during the summer season averaged 35% of initial live weight. There were differences between transects, with animals in the KKH gaining less weight in summer but showing higher milk yield (in cattle) and better reproductive performance. The results indicate a typical system of smallholder livestock production with heavy reliance on cereal by-products, a mix of livestock species and a relative scarcity of stored feed resources relative to overall livestock holdings. This study also suggests that proximity to the main highway running through the Northern Areas is associated with a reduced but more feed-efficient livestock production system. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan ### Plant products search: cereals ### Animal products search: milk ### Topics keywords: live weight;dairy cow;reproductive performance;mixed farming;dairy cattle;farming system;beef cattle ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2006,,"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment",,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.04.003,,#36772,,"",""
Sorghum response to fertilizer and nitrogen use effi ciency in Uganda,"","Abstract: Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is important for smallholder production in semiarid parts of Uganda. Grain yields are low because of low soil fertility. Little fertilizer is used. Yield response to N, P, and K application, economically optimal rates for N, P, and K (EONR, EOPR, and EOKR, respectively), and N use efficiency (NUE) were evaluated at 11 site-seasons. Mean sorghum yield with no N applied (N 0) was 0.69 Mg ha -1 and was consistently increased by a mean of 230% with N application. Mean EONRs were 34 to 18 kg ha -1 N with fertilizer use cost to grain price ratios (CPs) of 10 to 30, respectively. Mean EOPRs were 11 to 2 kg ha -1 P with CPs of 10 to 50, respectively. Sorghum did not respond to K application. Net economic returns were greater for N than P application. Mean aboveground biomass N with0 and 90 kg ha -1 N applied was 31. 3 and 75.9 kg ha -1, respectively. Grain N concentration, N harvest index, and internal NUE at the EONR were 1.67%, 53.2%, and 31.8 kg kg -1, respectively, and higher than for N0.

Stocking intensity and pastoral production. 1. Changes in the soil and vegetation of a sown pasture grazed by sheep at different stocking rates.,"","Abstract: A Phalaris tuberosa [= P. aquatica]/white clover pasture was grazed continuously in 1964-9 at stocking rates of 2.5-37.1 sheep/ha. Increase in stocking rate decreased herbage availability, root weight, basal cover, soil pore space and the rate of water infiltration and increased herbage bulk density and herbage contents of N and Ca. In periods of below-average rainfall, soil moisture and nitrate contents were greater when herbage availability was low. Herbage DM yield averaged 8.45 t/ha year and was not affected by stocking rates between 2 and 22 sheep/ha. The ratio herbage consumption:pasture production increased by 0.045 for each unit increase in stocking rate. ### Plant products search: cloves;clover ### Measurements for interventions: pasture ### Topics keywords: stocking rate;bulk density;DM;decision maker;soil moisture;SM;NH4;dairy farm;decision making;NO3;dry matter;beef cattle",1973,,"Journal of Agricultural Science, UK",,,,,,,#36320,,"",""
The cultivation-cattle complex in western Darfur.,"","Abstract: The agricultural/livestock system of a 40 000 km2 area in W. Sudan is described. Details of the 3 main components (traditional rainfed agriculture, small-scale irrigation and animal husbandry) are given. Millet (Pennisetum typhoides [P. americanum]) is the main cereal crop, but sorghum occupies an important place in the intensively cultivated alluvial zones and cash crops, including groundnuts, are of some importance. Agronomic and yield data on the traditional rainfed crops are given. Tabular data are given on the total annual production of carbohydrate and protein animal feed resources from natural grazing, crop residues and Acacia albida in alluvial valleys and non-alluvial areas, with information on the seasonal availability of carbohydrates and protein from each component. The distribution of resources was unusual in that most protein was available in mid to late dry season.

Unlocking the agricultural potential of manure in agropastoral systems: Traditional beliefs hindering its use in Southern Ethiopia,"","Abstract: Manure is often considered a valuable resource for improving productivity in semi-arid tropics. This paper investigated agropastoralist knowledge of the use of manure and barriers that limit manure use in Borana, southern Ethiopia. The potential and actual amounts of manure available on-farm and its relative economic value were estimated. Yield response to manure application was also quantified. Data was gathered using on-farm surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, field observation and on-farm experiments. We found that an enormous amount of manure with substantial fertilizer value and economic benefit had accumulated over the years in studied households in Borana. Our analysis revealed that, on average, more than 74 tons of manure containing 667 kg nitrogen (N)–more than five times the current requirements–had accumulated per farm. This manure has an economic value, in terms of N supply, equivalent to ETB (Ethiopian Birr) 16452 (US$802). On-farm trials showed that a considerable scope exists for increasing the yields of these marginal lands by using manure. However, because of the traditional beliefs and associated practices, which have prevailed for centuries in the community, this valuable resource is left unused. Having identified the link between traditional beliefs and non-use of manure, the paper sets out possible areas for intervention. ### Countries mentioned: Ethiopia ### Measurements for interventions: nitrogen;manure ### Topics keywords: NH4;food insecurity;economic benefit;NO3 ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2019,,Agriculture (Switzerland),,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture9030045,,#37248,,Ellen McCullough (2019-06-07 11:36:19)(Screen): Evaluates effect of beliefs about manure on use of manure as fertilizer.

"Socieconomic field assessment of dry farming technology in the Indo-UK project, Indore (India).","","Abstract: This paper describes the effects of the introduction of improved soil-, water-, crop- and livestock-management technology on Vertisols in the Indo-UK Project at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. Since 1974, when the project began, farmers on the 2000 ha area have markedly increased their adoption of HYVs of sorghum, wheat, and chickpea and have begun growing soybeans and maize as new crops. The area under kharif (rainy season) crops has risen substantially during the past four years from 32% of the gross cropped area to 54% in addition to a tenfold increase in the area double cropped. Along with increased use of fertilizers and irrigation, these changes have increased crop yields by 30 to 500%, and net returns per ha by an average of more than 170%. The technology has been labour and bullock intensive and this has favoured small farmers who have much higher man/land and bullock/land ratios than large farmers. ### Countries mentioned: India;United Kingdom;France ### Plant products search: wheat;sorghum grain;soybeans;maize;chickpeas ### Programs found: indo united kingdom (UK) project;united kingdom (UK) project ### Topics keywords: food insecurity;human activity;net return ### Geo regions: Europe and Central Asia;South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: High-income countries($12,056 or more);Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",1980,,"Proceedings.

Typology and socio-economic logic of cropping systems in Sub-Saharan agro-ecosystems of Burkina Faso.,"","Abstract: In Sub-Saharan zone of Burkina Faso, legumes and cereals mixed cultivation systems occupy most of the cultivated area. However, yields are low and often do not cover the food needs of farms that practise them. In order to improve the productivity of these intercropping systems, it is necessary to understand the socio economic logic of their implementation. To this purpose, sixty family farms were surveyed in the northern region of Burkina Faso. Multiple correspondences analysis (MCA) showed four types of cropping systems characterized on one hand by the level of organic matter intake and weeding frequency and on the other hand, by the presence of permanent structures for water and soil conservation. Organic matter fertilization and frequent weeding are associated with farms with high family labor, livestock (especially small ruminants) and high cultivated area, while 70% of farmers have an off-farm activity. The age of household head and the number of their wives are good indicators of farmers' income. Most of farmers' monetary recipes vary widely from 25 to 300 KFCFA. These aspects must be taken into consideration for reasoning suitable technical recommendations for the farmer's in this region. ### Countries mentioned: Burkina Faso ### Plant products search: legumes;cereals ### Topics keywords: animal husbandry;small ruminant;intercropping system;cropping system;net return;DM;OM;point view;agro ecosystem;management practice;pest control;farming system;organic matter;sustainable agriculture;long term;animal health ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2016,,International Journal of Biological and Chemical Sciences,,,,,,,#37181,,"",""
"Up-scaling potential impacts on water flows from agricultural water interventions: Opportunities and trade-offs in the osman sagar catchment, musi sub-basin, India","","Abstract: Agricultural water management (AWM) has been shown to improve and secure yields in the tropics and has been suggested as an important way to combat poverty in the region. In this paper, we describe potential impacts on upstream and downstream flows of extensive AWM interventions, using the watershed development programme of the Osman Sagar catchment of Musi sub-basin, Andhra Pradesh semi-arid India, as an example. Various AWM interventions are compared with a non-intervention state and the current state of the study area, using 31 years of data by application of the calibrated and validated ARCSWAT 2005 (Version 2.1.4a) modelling tool. Different AWM interventions contribute to improved livelihoods of upstream smallholder farmers by increasing soil moisture availability and groundwater recharge, which can subsequently be used for irrigation. The result is higher crop production and hence larger incomes. Moreover, lower flow intensities and sediment losses reduced by 30-50%, reducing the risk of flooding and sediment accumulation in the Osman Sagar drinking water reservoir. On the other hand, AWM interventions are predicted to result in reduced total water inflows to the Osman Sagar reservoir from 11% of the total annual rainfall (754mm) recorded at present, to 8% if AWM interventions were implemented at large scale throughout the catchment. A cost-benefit analysis of AWM interventions showed that the highest net economic returns were achieved at intermediate intervention levels (only in-situ AWM). ### Countries mentioned: India ### Programs found: development program;watershed development program (WDP) ### Topics keywords: trade offs;ecosystem service;environmental impact;soil moisture;drinking water;SM;crop residue;large scale;smallholder farmer ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,Hydrological Processes,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.9516,,#36414,,"",Experimental
Wheat management practices and factors of yield decline in the Punjab province of Pakistan.,"","Abstract: Wheat is the main staple diet of the people of Pakistan. There were different views for wheat yield decline and crisis in the country during 2007-08. To assess the wheat situation and compare wheat production practices to identify the major factors of yield decline, a national level field survey was conducted during June 2008 by Social Sciences Division, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council through its satellite institutes in the provinces. Total 238 wheat growers were purposively selected from different cropping zones of the Punjab province as sample of the national survey. The survey results reveal that decline in wheat area, the incidence of frost/cold spells, shortage of irrigation water over normal supplies, imbalanced use of fertilizers particularly of DAP fertilizer below the recommended doses, higher prices of inputs such as seed, fertilizer, diesel, electricity and less wheat prices during 2006-07 and late announcement of the minimum guaranteed wheat price for 2007-08 were the main reasons of lower wheat production in 2007-08. To enhance the wheat yield, farmers were of the view that the timely availability of quality inputs (seed, fertilizers) at reasonable prices, canal water supply at critical stages of plant growth, and affordable diesel and electricity prices should be ensured. Timely availability of credit to the resource poor farmers would also enhance the wheat yield in Punjab. ### Countries mentioned: Pakistan ### Plant products search: wheat ### Measurements for crops: wheat ### Topics keywords: agro food;survey conducted;factor affecting;management practice ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: BLEND;Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895)",2010,,Pakistan Journal of Agricultural Research,,,,,,,#37311,,"",Observational
The status of crop-livestock systems and evolution toward integration.,"","Abstract: This article presents the current state of crop-livestock systems in developing countries, and reviews the recent literature on ""crop-livestock integration"" as an alternative landuse option for agro-pastoralists to cope with the changing environment in Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions. Mixed crop-livestock systems are one of the dominant agricultural systems in the developing world. While crop-livestock systems tremendously vary across different biophysical and demographic settings, agro-pastoralists face challenges such as population growth and globalization. Changes in the lifestyles of agro-pastoralists and market access tend to lead to commercialized farming, while population pressures lead to scarcities and degradation of resources for conventional extensive farming. Crop-livestock integration is viewed as an economically feasible and environmentally sound solution for poor agro-pastoralists to achieve sustainable agricultural production. Optimal pathways for crop-livestock integration should achieve the best utilization of locally available resources without much reliance on external inputs through recycling of crop/animal residuals. Although such pathways may be determined by use of systems analysis, it is recognized that the realities of the system are often more complicated than the predicted optimal pathways suggest, due to diversities in agro-ecological, demographic, and market conditions as well as to socio-economic factors. Hence, this review investigates the determinants of crop-livestock intensification and summarizes inferences for future research challenges. It draws the conclusion that crop-livestock integration should be analyzed from a holistic/integrated perspective. ### Topics keywords: value chain;developing country;SSA;developing world;smallholder farmer;social capital;market access ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa",2007,,Annals of Arid Zone,,,,,,,#37104,,Nicola Randall (2019-06-06 20:26:48)(Screen): review; ,""
"Where is the limit? Lessons learned from long-term conservation agriculture research in Zimuto Communal Area, Zimbabwe.","","Abstract: Smallholder farming in Zimbabwe is increasingly affected by dwindling maize (Zea mays L.) yields due to declining soil fertility and the negative effects of climate variability and change. A long-term on-farm study was established between 2004 and 2013 at the Zimuto Communal Area near Masvingo, Southern Zimbabwe to test the feasibility and viability of conservation agriculture (CA) systems under the circumstances of low fertility and erratic rainfall. CA seeding systems based on animal traction excelled and significantly increased maize productivity by up to 235% (1761 kg ha-1) and legume productivity by 173% (265 kg ha-1) as compared to the conventional control treatment. Soil quality indicators such as infiltration and soil carbon improved 64-96% and 29-97%, respectively, over time. However, a direct link between increased infiltration and grain yield could not be established. Increased plant population, because of greater precision and moisture conservation during direct seeding as well as an improved response to fertilizer application due to gradually increasing soil carbon could be the reasons why yields on CA systems out-yielded the conventional control. CA systems were more economically viable than planting crops under the normal conventional practice with mouldboard ploughs and removal of crop residues. Farmers generally rated important crop characteristics of maize planted under CA as high but weed control was rated as low, due to the lack of an appropriate herbicide under the prevailing environment. The results of this study show that CA is a potential option even in areas of climate risk and low soil fertility. However, the adoption of CA was low amongst members of the rural farming community due to the perceived risk of crop failure, lack of appropriate and accessible inputs and markets for farm produce, and lack of appropriate information and knowledge about alternative agricultural methods. This highlights the need for better resource and input availability as well as more vibrant and efficient extension services. Successful CA promotion requires that the systems are adapted to farmers' circumstances. However, CA cannot expand where farmers depend on remittances, are donor dependent, and where crop production in general is doubtful. Land uses such as extensive livestock production or game ranching may be better and more profitable alternatives for farmers in these situations. ### Countries mentioned: Zimbabwe ### Plant products search: legumes;maize;grain ### Topics keywords: cropping system;CA;soil fertility;factor affecting;point view;adoption CA;smallholder farming;farming system;negative effect;long term;human health;cluster analysis;climate variability;zea may L;short term;food insecurity;genetic diversity;climate change;spatial distribution;trace element;growing season;weed control;factor influencing;crop residue;extension service;smallholder farmer;human activity;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);BLEND",2015,,Food Security,,,,,,,#36209,,"",Observational
Yield Gaps and Ecological Footprints of Potato Production Systems in Chile [electronic resource].,"","Abstract: In Chile, potatoes are grown in a wide range of ecological zones and levels of technology resulting in wide ranges of crop management and yields. The aim of the present study was to assess yield gaps, resource use efficiencies and foot-printing in different potato cropping zones between 18 and 53℗' South considering early and late crops, small and large holdings (>10ï¿ư ha/year) and ware and seed potato crops. Two mathematical tools were used to generate data for comparisons: the light interception and utilization simulator for potato crops (LINTUL-Potato) to calculate potential yields and water need of each system and the Cool Farm Tool – Potato (CFT) to calculate the amount of CO₂ associated with the production of 1ï¿ư ton of potato. Meteorological data for LINTUL-Potato came from official services, and data needed to complete the CFT came from a survey carried out for the 10 sites yielding amounts of inputs and number of operations, potato yields and planting and harvesting dates. The survey yielded 20 cropping systems with an average yield of 31ï¿ư tï¿ư ha⁻℗£. Yields were related to daily growth rate and not to the length of the growing season. Considerable variation was found in resource-use efficiency and CO₂ emission. It was concluded that large farms show a lower land footprint than small farms due to a higher technological level, but while applying more water and fertilizer, they result in higher water and CO₂ footprints. Late crops may fetch higher off-season prices but have higher land, water and CO₂ footprints. The most suitable potato production systems are the rain-fed summer crops in the South with the lowest footprints. The highest footprints have the irrigated winter crops in the centre of Chile. The subsistence high altitude Andean crop in the utmost North has the highest land footprint but the lowest CO₂ emission. The description, analysis and benchmarking of the potato production systems in Chile allow strategies for improving footprints and profitability and yields information about future investments in research, development and production of the crop. ### Countries mentioned: Chile ### Plant products search: tuber;potatoes;stone fruits ### Measurements for interventions: cropping;cropping system ### Topics keywords: cropping system;trace element;human health;EF;growing season;use efficiency;N2O;wide range;CO2;yield gap;pest control;management practice ### Geo regions: Latin America and the Caribbean ### World bankdivision regions: IBRD;High-income countries($12,056 or more)",2014,,Potato research,,,,,https://proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=agr&AN=IND600799926&site=ehost-live,,#36858,,"Nicola Randall (2019-06-06 19:38:23)(Screen): probably not relevant, but there may be some comparison between  different water application methods & yield that may be of value to happy to  take to next stage if others would like to ; ",Experimental

Yield and soil system changes from conservation tillage in dryland farming: a case study from North Eastern Tanzania.,"","Abstract: Yield levels in smallholder farming systems in semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa are generally low. Water shortage in the root zone during critical crop development stages is a fundamental constraining factor. While there is ample evidence to show that conservation tillage can promote soil health, it has recently been suggested that the main benefit in semi-arid farming systems may in fact be an in situ water harvesting effect. In this paper we present the result from an on-farm conservation tillage experiment (combining ripping with mulch and manure application) that was carried out in North Eastern Tanzania from 2005 to 2008. Special attention was given to the effects of the tested treatment on the capacity of the soil to retain moisture. The tested conservation treatment only had a clear yield increasing effect during one of the six experimental seasons (maize grain yields increased by 41%, and biomass by 65%), and this was a season that received exceptional amounts of rainfall (549 mm). While the other seasons provided mixed results, there seemed to be an increasing yield gap between the conservation tillage treatment and the control towards the end of the experiment, and cumulatively the yield increased with 17%. Regarding soil system changes, small but significant effects on chemical and microbiological properties, but not on physical properties, were observed. This raises questions about the suggested water harvesting effect and its potential to contribute to stabilized yield levels under semi-arid conditions. We conclude that, at least in a shorter time perspective, the tested type of conservation tillage seems to boost productivity during already good seasons, rather than stabilize harvests during poor rainfall seasons. Highlighting the challenges involved in upgrading these farming systems, we discuss the potential contribution of conservation tillage towards improved water availability in the crop root zone in a longer term perspective. ### Countries mentioned: Tanzania ### Plant products search: maize;grain ### Topics keywords: water saving;soil fertility;bulk density;SSA;water shortage;drip irrigation;moisture content;smallholder farming;root zone;farming system;NT;longer term;conservation tillage;physical property;yield gap;management practice;short term;soil moisture;crop residue;smallholder farmer;CT;grain yield ### Geo regions: Sub-Saharan Africa ### World bankdivision regions: Low-income countries(995$ or less);IDA",2011,,Agricultural Water Management,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2010.02.013,,#36503,,"",""
"Yield evaluation of some cultivars of mungbean (<i xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"">Vigna radiata</i> (L) Wilczek) in southern guinea savanna location of Nigeria.","","Abstract: Field experiment was conducted in the early and late seasons of 2006 to determine mungbean ( (L) Wilczek) cultivars that are high yielding in the guinea savanna zone of Nigeria. The experiment was sited at the research farm of the university of Agriculture, Makurdi, Nigeria. Treatments included five mungbean cultivars (local variety, Vc 2768A, Vc 1178A, Vc 2778A, and Vc 1973A) arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replications. Parameters assessed included plant height (cm), number of branches per plant, number of nodules per plant, number of pods per plant, 1000 seed weight (g) and grain yield (kg/ha). The result showed that there was no significant difference between the cultivars in terms plant height and the number of branches per plant, Vc 2768A was the tallest cultivar while Vc2778A was the shortest. Number of nodules per plant differed significantly between the cultivars. Vc 2768A gave the highest grain yield of 2266.67 kg/ha while the lowest yield of 441.67 kg/ha was obtained from Vc 2778A lower than the yield obtained from local variety (891.67 kg/ha).

Yield and economic performance of organic and conventional cotton-based farming systems - Results from a field trial in India,"","Abstract: The debate on the relative benefits of conventional and organic farming systems has in recent time gained significant interest. So far, global agricultural development has focused on increased productivity rather than on a holistic natural resource management for food security. Thus, developing more sustainable farming practices on a large scale is of utmost importance. However, information concerning the performance of farming systems under organic and conventional management in tropical and subtropical regions is scarce. This study presents agronomic and economic data from the conversion phase (2007-2010) of a farming systems comparison trial on a Vertisol soil in Madhya Pradesh, central India. A cotton-soybean-wheat crop rotation under biodynamic, organic and conventional (with and without Bt cotton) management was investigated. We observed a significant yield gap between organic and conventional farming systems in the 1 st crop cycle (cycle 1: 2007-2008) for cotton (-29%) and wheat (-27%), whereas in the 2 nd crop cycle (cycle 2: 2009-2010) cotton and wheat yields were similar in all farming systems due to lower yields in the conventional systems. In contrast, organic soybean (a nitrogen fixing leguminous plant) yields were marginally lower than conventional yields (-1% in cycle 1, -11% in cycle 2). Averaged across all crops, conventional farming systems achieved significantly higher gross margins in cycle 1 (+29%), whereas in cycle 2 gross margins in organic farming systems were significantly higher (+25%) due to lower variable production costs but similar yields. Soybean gross margin was significantly higher in the organic system (+11%) across the four harvest years compared to the conventional systems. Our results suggest that organic soybean production is a viable option for smallholder farmers under the prevailing semi-arid conditions in India. Future research needs to elucidate the long-term productivity and profitability, particularly of cotton and wheat, and the ecological impact of the different farming systems. ### Countries mentioned: India ### Plant products search: soybeans;cotton;wheat ### Topics keywords: organic farming;natural resource;land degradation;sweet potato;contract farming;gross margin;chemical fertilizer;CF;taking account;large scale;farming practice;pest control;farming system;beef cattle;GM;long term;small scale;natural resource management;crop rotation;DM;non GM;bt cotton;yield gap;farm size;management practice;food security;smallholder farmer;sustainable agriculture ### Geo regions: South Asia ### World bankdivision regions: Middle-income countries($996 to $3,895);IBRD",2013,,PLoS ONE,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081039,,#37522,,"",Experimental
