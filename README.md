This folder contains analysis for the Ceres2030 Team 6, who are conducting a semi-automated systematic map from academic and grey literatures.

Our analysis will be completed in 3 stages.

  1. We use manually coded abstracts to build a natural language processing model to include or exclude abstracts to our study.
See bert_text_classification.ipynb for main analysis and results.

  2. We use look up tables to extract key information from each article's full-text. TBD.

  3. We compile all visualizations for publication. TBD.
